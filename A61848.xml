            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Box of Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard is broken; no wonder; for we have this treaſure in earthen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: when thou haſt ſmelt the ſavour of this precious ointment, I doubt not but that thou wilt ſee cauſe to bleſs that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which hath order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the endeavor of them that have ſtudied the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it from loſs; In this Paper-Veſſel
<pb facs="tcp:41800:8"/> wherein it is commended to thee. The Author was a burning and a ſhining Light, as theſe and other his Sermons do bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for they carry light into the underſtanding, and heat into the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the light not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notional; the heat like that of the Sun, quickning, and prolifical: both are ſuch as are requiſite in a man that is in purſuance of his Chiefeſt Good, which is the noble ſubject of this Treatiſe, that points you to it, teaches the way of attainment of it; marks
<pb facs="tcp:41800:8"/> it out with ſuch Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as do diſcriminate it from falſe treaſure; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the appetite unto the proſecution and fruition of it. And in ſhort, ſhews you the ſhorteſt way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your own happineſs; whereof this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that being but one, it alone makes the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors happy, becauſe it doth eminently compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in it all other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: And this he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches not to be treaſure on earth; but that it muſt be laid up by you on earth,
<pb facs="tcp:41800:9"/> as fruit gathered in the Orchard is thrown over the wall to be taken up when you are gone out. I undertake not to write the life, but commend the Labours of the man to thee; he was of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently tempered Spirit, both for humility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; one that was not afraid to follow the truth cloſe at the heels (though ſometimes it ſtrike out ones teeth) but an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox propugnator of it; his ſtile is very familiar; in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Scripture he is acute and accurate, a
<pb facs="tcp:41800:9"/> great ſearcher of hidden Treaſures; a friend unto Free Grace, an advancer of practical holineſs; when it fell in his way to ſtrike wicked men with repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, his arrow ſo pierced, that it is manifeſt he drew a ſtrong Bow; when he had to deal with a wounded ſpirit, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſoft touch, that he had felt the wounds himſelf.

                  <p>The words are ſummed up in two Propoſitions, which are of marvellous high concernment both.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41800:30"/> 1. <hi>That every man hath a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this life.</hi> He ſpeaks it as an act to be performed not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, but in the life that now is: <hi>Hic mundus laboris,</hi> that <hi>mercedis:</hi> this life is the ſowing time, that the reaping; this is the world of labour, that of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; here is the treaſuring time, there is the expending time, therefore every man hath a treaſure in this life: ſo Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Where your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is,</hi> &amp;c. therefore lay that for a ground, Every man hath a treaſure; <hi>a treaſure in this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That whereſoever the treaſure is, it is attractive of the heart: Or thus, every man lays up his heart where he lays up his treaſure.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of them I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon at this time; every
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41800:30"/> man lays up a treaſure for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this life: every man hath ſomething which is his, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, his own treaſure; <hi>Where your treaſure is,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall firſt a little explain the words, to open the notion of a treaſure, as the Scripture ſpeaks of it.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the Holy Ghoſt in the Scripture ſpeaks of:</p>
                  <p>God hath his treaſures,</p>
                  <p>Men have their treaſures.</p>
                  <p>Firſt God hath his treaſures, and they are of four ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Theſauri naturae:</hi> there are the treaſures of nature, which we read of in <hi>Job</hi> 38. 22. <hi>Haſt thou entred into the trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſures of the ſnow; or haſt thou ſeen the treaſures of the hail?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Lord when he ſpeaks of the bleſſings of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41800:31"/> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 12. ſaith, he will open his good treaſure, the heaven to give rain, &amp;c. and <hi>ler.</hi> 10. 13. he bringeth the wind out of his treaſures: theſe are the treaſures of nature that are Gods treaſures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Recondita provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae:</hi> there are the treaſures of providence: in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 14. he ſpeaks it of wicked men. Theſe are the ungodly, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in the world; they have their portion in this life, whoſe bellies thou filleſt with thy hid treaſure: What be thoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with which God is ſaid to fill ungodly mens bellies? Interpreters do obſerve, that there are ſome wicked men in this life, that have not only the common benefits of nature with the reſt of this World, that God cauſes the Sun to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41800:31"/> ſhine, and the rain to fall upon them; but he doth afford them <hi>ezquiſitas quaſdam divitias</hi> ſome peculiar and choice mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this world; and doth in Providence order it ſo, that of all the honours in the world many ungodly men ſhall have the higheſt, of all the powers in the world many ungodly men ſhal have the greateſt: the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of providence: the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times affords them to thoſe who have their portion in this world: but remember the text ſaith, <hi>He fils their bellies with treaſures:</hi> tis but to ſatisfie their ſenſes, it never fils their ſouls; their ſouls be empty of grace when their bellies be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with treaſures: how many ungodly wretches have the quinteſſence of all things, all the Lords treaſure? &amp; yet ſo tis ordered.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41800:32"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, <hi>Theſauri gratiae,</hi> the treaſures of grace, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge.</hi> It is ſaid of Chriſt, in him are hid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whoſe are they? Why, they are his treaſures that hid the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> there; the Lord hid theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: <hi>He is made to us of God, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and redemption:</hi> the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom and grace are laid up in Jeſus Chriſt as in a common treaſury, but they be Gods treaſures.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Theſauri vindictionis,</hi> there are yet treaſures of vengeance, treaſures of wrath, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 34. <hi>Are not theſe things laid up by me, ſealed up among my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures?</hi> Many an ungodly man and wicked woman goes along ten years, twenty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as they treaſure up
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41800:32"/> ſin, I treaſure up wrath; and vengeance is mine, and I will repay it; their feet ſhall ſlide in due time, the mean time I wil forget none of their works; <hi>they are ſealed up by me among my treaſures:</hi> theſe are Gods trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the Scripture ſpeaks of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, men have their treaſures alſo, and that which a man makes his chief good, wherein he doth place his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that by which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his life comes, in that is a mans treaſure: you ſhall ſee it expreſt in other words, but the thing is one: in <hi>Luk</hi> 16. 25. <hi>Abraham</hi> is brought in there ſpeaking to <hi>Dives</hi> in hell: <hi>Son, remember in thy life time thou hadſt thy good things:</hi> that which Chriſt here cals <hi>your treaſure,</hi> there <hi>Abraham</hi> cals <hi>thy good things:</hi> and in <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41800:33"/> 17. 14. they have <hi>their portion in this life;</hi> that which in this place is called <hi>a mans treaſure,</hi> that is there called <hi>their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but the thing is the ſame: and here give me leave to note the great difference between godly men and the men of the world: the men of the world are all for great proviſion in the way, but care not what portion they have at end: but a godly man is quite contrary, he will be content with ſmall proviſion, but it is not a ſmall portion will content him; a little in the paſſage, but he muſt have a large portion. So that which a man pitches upon as his chief good, by which the main comfort of his life comes in, theſe are his good things, that is his portion, his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but only thus far for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41800:33"/> the opening of the phraſe.</p>
                  <p>Let us now come to open the Doctrine to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every man hath in this life a treaſure, his own treaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I ſhall explain by clearing four ſeveral propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all which are included in the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, every man hath ſome chief good which his ſoul is ſet upon, and which as its cen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter it tends unto. I ſay every man: there's not a perſon of you but you have ſome chief good to which your ſouls do bend, and upon which they center, wherein you place your happineſs, which if you could attain perfectly, your ſouls would be at reſt. This is that which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 7. <hi>Return unto thy reſt, oh my ſoul.</hi> Why what was the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41800:34"/> reſt of his ſoul? truly the reſt of his ſoul was his chief good: and wil you ſee what that was? in the 73. <hi>Pſalm, Whom have I in heaven but thee, and I deſire none on earth in compariſon of thee:</hi> if a man have a chief good, it muſt either be on earth or in heaven: but ſaith <hi>David,</hi> God is my chief good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaven or in earth; and thats the reaſon why he cals God the Reſt of his ſoul; and for this cauſe he tels you all the tendency of his ſoul went after God. <hi>My ſoul is athirſt for God, the living God:</hi> many ſuch expreſſions you have to let you ſee that God was his chief good: and until the ſoul attain its chief good, it is never at reſt, but is <hi>in perpetuo motu,</hi> in a continual tendency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But on the other ſide, take a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41800:34"/> poor carnal wretch that never knew any thing above the creature, becauſe the creature is his chief good, and that not to be had in perfection, ſo that he cannot attain to his full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, therefore his ſoul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually reſtleſs: ſee him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. 6. to <hi>ver.</hi> 14. ungodly men are ſaid <hi>like a dog to run about the city,</hi> and <hi>like a dog to grudge and not be ſatisfied;</hi> what is the meaning of it? you know how many weariſom la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours this creature takes, and all is for meat, and yet many times altogether in vain: now ungodly men in the purſuit of the things of this life are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to dogs; how many circles do they take this way and that way; but many times altogether in vain, for they are never ſatisfied, and when they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41800:35"/> are not ſatisfied, they grudge; ſo that you ſee ſometimes the dog when he hath eaten caſts up his meat, and afterwards turns to his vomit again: here tis brought in only to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to let you ſee how reſtleſs their ſouls are, becauſe they ſeek good in them. But there is one Scripture very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 29. <hi>But the ſoul of my Lord ſhall be bound up in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God: but the ſoul of thine enemies them he will ſling out as out of the midſt of a ſling:</hi> to have <hi>Davids</hi> ſoul bound up with God in the bundle of the living, that you may a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; but to have ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mens ſouls ſlung out by God out of the midſt of a ſling; what is that? to ſling ſouls? truly there are three
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41800:35"/> things in it: Firſt it notes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as when you ſling a ſtone, you caſt it far from you: <hi>The Lord ſhall put the wicked far from him.</hi> Such expreſſions are frequent in Scripture. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it notes a diſtance in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Lord binds up ſouls in the bundle of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in mercy: So in wrath he ſlings out the ſouls of ungodly men. Thirdly, it doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note diſtance, but violence; when the Lord will do it with a ſudden violent motion, as when ſtones are ſlung out of a ſling; when the ſouls of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men have nothing to reſt upon, but yet ſome chief good they fancy to themſelves, which they think if they could obtain they would be at reſt: I am perſwaded there is many of them do think, if I had as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41800:36"/> much riches, as much honors, as much pleaſures as I would, my ſoul would then be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and be much content, as the fool in the Goſpel: Soul, take thy reſt, thou haſt goods laid up for many years; thus every man hath ſome chief good or other to which his ſoul tends, and till he attain it, his ſoul is reſtleſs; this is the firſt particular, for the opening of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, every man hath ſome chief good in this life in regard of election: my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that there is ſome chief good he chooſes to himſelf in this life: I do not ſay he enjoys it in this life: for the hope of the Saints is not in this life, but yet for all that they chooſe it here below: thou hadſt in thy life time thy good things: its
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41800:36"/> not only true of ungodly men, but even of godly men; only the one hath fruition in this life, the other but election on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the one enjoys his portion here, the other hath it in the life to come; but a portion he doth chooſe here: the election is below, the fruition is to come: for remember that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is no inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the grave</hi> whither you are going: ſo there is no electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the grave; the good that you chooſe here to your ſelves you muſt enjoy for ever: ſome chooſe pleaſures, ſome chooſe wantonneſs, ſome chooſe vanity. Truly look to it, that is no portion: that which you have choſen here, you will enjoy hereafter: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider withall, that after death is the Judgement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41800:37"/> meaning is not the general Judgement, though that be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, but a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death; but the Judgement that paſſeth on every particular man when he dyeth, that Judgement will be an eternal Judgement: there will be no reverſion: for there is a <hi>gulph</hi> ſet between us and you: an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of eſtate that follows this life: therefore while you live here indeed there is a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a man may change his chief good; he that made wealth, honour, or pleaſure his chief good, he may by the patience of God chooſe the Lord for his chief Good; but after this life there is no change; that which is your chief good in this life, you muſt content your ſelves with for ever; every man hath in this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41800:37"/> life his chief good: I mean not in regard of fruition, but of election.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, every man in this life hath his own chief good: it is <hi>your treaſure;</hi> that which is one mans treaſure is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; <hi>thy good things, and your treaſure,</hi> and <hi>their portion;</hi> this the Scripture ſpeaks of theſe things: for you muſt know, every man doth chooſe <hi>to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> a good that may properly be called <hi>his own.</hi> As, pray will you but obſerve in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 6. <hi>The fear of the Lord is his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> and ſome others do obſerve, that this is peculiarly ſpoken of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and in him of the Church of God: and its ſaid, <hi>wiſdom and knowledge ſhall be the ſtability of thy times, the fear of the Lord is his treaſure:</hi> Pray what is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41800:38"/> meant by the fear of the Lord? I conceive theſe two things, as uſually the fear of the Lord carries with it this double ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Reverential fear and awe of the majeſty of God, from a right apprehenſion of his greatneſs and holineſs; ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom,</hi> that is, God being rightly known, and the ſoul thereby duely overawed; a man had never any wiſdom till this entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſoul: nay the word is, the top of wiſdom. In this lies the perfection of all his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if he had never ſo much.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the fear of the Lord alſo is meant an awfull worſhip of God, to <hi>worſhip God with reverence and godly fear;</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41800:38"/> the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 9. <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean:</hi> he ſpeaks it of the worſhip of God: compare the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all Religions in the world, all their worſhip is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; they be the more defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for all their worſhip, whereas they that worſhip God in his way, they be the more holy: now will ye ſet what was <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> great treaſure? the fear of the Lord is his treaſure: that is, in the holy awe he had of God, and the conſtant worſhip he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, in theſe lay his treaſure: but is this every mans treaſure? No, I can tell you a great many account the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God their burthen, look on it as their miſery, not their treaſure. How comes it to paſs that every man hath
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41800:39"/> his own treaſure? On theſe three accounts a treaſure or chief good may be ſaid to be his own.</p>
                  <p>1. From the differing lights men have, ſome men ſee good, where other men ſee none: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>We look upon things that are not ſeen:</hi> Some men have ſuch eyes: other men can go no further then the ſight of their eyes: and ſo ſome men have <hi>the eyes of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings inlightened to know what is the riches of glory in the Saints, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 17, 18. other men cannot ſee ſo far off, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the riches and glory the Saints have in their ſalvation, nor Chriſt in them: but 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>the god of this world hath blinded their eyes,</hi> that is, they look upon every thing as the Devil repreſents
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41800:39"/> them; you know when Satan tempted Chriſt, he ſhewed him all the Kingdoms in the world and the glory of them. The Devil repreſented them in his own glaſs. Take a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that thinks riches a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant thing, and honors a very fine thing; hee ſees theſe as the Devil repreſents them. But for the duties of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the word of God, and a regular walking, he ſees no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in theſe. Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are repreſented in a glaſs that makes them moſt odious to that man; and hence it is that men have different good things, becauſe they look on things with different light, and eyes: one man ſees things as repreſented by Gods Spirit, another looks on things in the Devils Glaſs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41800:40"/> this is one Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe men have different taſts and ſavours as well as different lights. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They that are after the fleſh, ſavour the things of the fleſh, and they that are after the ſpirit, ſavour the things of the ſpirit;</hi> that is, take ſpiritual things; he that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, finds no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor in them then in the white of an egg, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks: the ſweetneſs of a promiſe is no more to him, then if he ſuckt a dry ſtick, he hath no ſavour: on the other ſide, tell him of riches, and plentie, and honors, propheſie to him of wine and ſtrong drink, and he taſts a ſavour and ſweetneſs in them, he is able to relliſh it: and this is the true Reaſon why men have ſuch different chief
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41800:40"/> goods, becauſe they have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſavors: they can taſte a ſweetneſs in dainty meats, and gorgeous apparel, and in the pleaſures of ſin: but now another man, he comes to look on the word of God, and he ſaith, Tis ſweeter to me <hi>then the honey, or the honey comb.</hi> The Philoſopher ſaith of all ſenſitive creatures, <hi>vitam guſtu ducunt,</hi> they live by taſte: the truth is, if rightly underſtood, ſo do all rational creatures too live by taſte: one man lives the life of God: Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he taſts the things of God: another man lives the life of Satan: Why? becauſe he taſts the things of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: he hath no ſavor, no ſweetneſs in any other thing: and thats the true reaſon why vain, fooliſh people in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41800:41"/> world run after ſuch vanities, tis becauſe they ſavor no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, men chooſe to themſelves different good things; it proceeds I ſay from their own choice; I cannot now ſtand to diſtinguiſh, as the Schoolmen do, between E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Volition; but that's the meaning, That that men will for themſelves, that they chooſe. Would you know why <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Gods peculiar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; it was becauſe God choſe them himſelf, <hi>I have choſen you to be my people.</hi> So how comes it to paſs that God is one mans treaſure and not another? one man chooſes him: therefore you ſhall find ſtill that a man that hath made choice of God as his chief good, he ſaith, Let me enjoy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41800:41"/> God, and if I have nothing elſe, I ſhall be content. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? there's none on earth, whom I deſire in compariſon of thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> The good of the Creature is not the good I chooſe; but another man that chooſes the things of this life to himſelf, riches, honours; pleaſures, ſaith he, Let me have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things here, and though I have never any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God all my life long. Let them take ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Sermons that take pleaſure in them: but let me enjoy my pleaſures and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and I can be content to be without God for ever. So that if a man enjoy his chief good, he is content. This is the third Propoſition.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:41800:42"/>
                  <p> Fourthly, this chief good, which every man chooſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light and taſte he hath, is in the Scripture called <hi>a mans treaſure:</hi> you ſee every man hath a chief good, and every man hath his chief good in this life, and every man hath his own chief good. Now this chief good that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man chooſes to himſelf, that is in Scripture called his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and tis ſo upon a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold accompt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the preciouſneſs of it in a mans own eſteem: treaſures are never made up but of things precious; no man ſpeaks of treaſures of dung, or treaſures of ſtones, they be precious things that be a mans treaſure: and therefore when the Lord ſpeaks of precious things, he calls them a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41800:42"/> the Lord Jeſus laid up in the Goſpel, is called <hi>the treaſure hid in the field,</hi> Matth. 13. 44. And ſo the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a depoſitum laid up with thoſe to whom the <hi>Miniſtry of reconciliation</hi> is committed, is called <hi>a treaſure in earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. So that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure carries a preciouſneſs with it, whether it be in truth or in appearance: for example, take a man whoſe chief good is in God, this is his treaſure. Why? ſaith he, take away God from me, and I am undone. So on the other ſide, take another man that makes wealth his treaſure, or bravery his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Take theſe things from me, and the comfort of my life is gone: thoſe that love to be alway praying or hearing, I wonder what comfort they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41800:43"/> can have, I would not live ſuch a life for a world: that's the firſt reaſon why tis called a treaſure, for the preciouſneſs of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, tis called a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for its plenty; for it is not a little that makes a treaſure: If a man have a few pieces of gold, you do not ſay he hath a treaſure: no, it is plenty that makes a treaſure, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge; plenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem denotat,</hi> Notes the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo that treaſure carries plenty in the notion of it, and it muſt needs be ſo; for what ever is a mans chief good, he defires <hi>appetitu infinito,</hi> with an infinite appetite. Take a man that makes riches his treaſure, and he inlarges his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41800:43"/> deſires as hell, and is not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and a man that deſires pleaſures, cries always as the horſe-leaches daughter, Give, give; let him glut himſelf to day, and he is hungry to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: Why? becauſe it his is chief good: ſo take a man whoſe chief good is laid up in God, though he have glorious in-comes from God, he is ſtill calling for more and more, more grace from him, more communion with him, more conſolation from the Spirit of God. Why? it is his chief good. The Spirit ſays Come, and the Bride ſays Come.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, tis called a mans treaſure, becauſe it is that by which a man doth value him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: pray mark it, as look how much a man hath in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo much he conceives he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41800:44"/> is worth: ſo look what is a mans chief good, by that the man doth value himſelf: there is a rate that the world puts upon a man, and a rate that the man puts upon himſelf: a rate that the world puts upon men, and they value their own as they love their own: and as for thoſe they ſee God hath taken out of the world, they are men of no worth: but there is a value and a rate that every man puts upon himſelf, and that is by the treaſure that he hath, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaid, <hi>Is not this great Babel that I have built for the glory of my majeſty:</hi> he ſpeaks of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: ſo <hi>Paul</hi> valued himſelf according to his moral righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and thought that ſhould have been gain to him: thus men do value themſelves:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41800:44"/> but how doth God value them? he hath his rate on men too, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 20. he values men according to their hearts: God doth not value men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their eſtates, their names, their birth: God values no man ſo, but God values them according to their hearts: and therefore he ſaith, <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth:</hi> thus you ſee that men value themſelves according to their treaſure: &amp; upon this account it is that a godly man doth, and ought to do, ſet a higher value upon himſelf, then all the men in the world: becauſe thereby he ſets a price upon his treaſure: as <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſtood before King <hi>Agrippa:</hi> who was the better man now, <hi>Paul</hi> or the King? <hi>I would that thou wert ſuch an one as I am,</hi> though he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41800:45"/> were a priſoner at the Bar, and the other a King: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Paul</hi> values himſelf beyond him; wiſhes, I would his condition were no worſe then mine: thus a mans treaſure is, that by which every man values himſelf, and thinks he is ſo much worth: And upon theſe three Reaſons, a mans chief good is called his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cauſe of the price he ſets upon it; the plenty he labours after in it, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and eſteem he puts upon himſelf by it; and ſo much for the opening of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Uſe is of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will put every one of you to it: you have a treaſure, and tis either in heaven or earth. If it be a treaſure on earth, where thy treaſure is,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41800:45"/> there is thy heart: and where thy heart is, there is thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and where thy happineſs is, thy God is: that I will tell thee, and there you muſt look for your ſalvation; therefore you have a treaſure, and tis ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on earth or in heaven: if your treaſure be on earth, there is your chief good, and your portion is below. But how ſhould a man know it, that every man may be able to ſay unto himſelf, where my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is, there my heart is: there are ſix Rules that I ſhall offer at preſent, though I ſhall give further light into it by Gods aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what is it that you dig for, that you labour moſt for, that you are willing <hi>to ſpend your money for,</hi> as the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks? This is the firſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41800:46"/> trial, <hi>if thou dig for wiſdom, as for hidden treaſure, Prov.</hi> 2. 4. what is it that you labour for? <hi>labour not for the meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, Joh.</hi> 6. 57. What is the great thing you work for in this life? that is your treaſure: what is it that you lay out your money for? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. that a man could willingly be at any coſt to obtain, to part with any thing for: now what is it for that you do it, that is your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Now when any man ſhall return to his own heart, and ſay, Truly I have laboured for wealth all my days, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried my ſelf in ſeeking after pleaſures and vanity all my days: and I that have been ſtraight-handed enough, in reference to what belongs to God and ſpiritual things: yet I have been liberal enough for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41800:46"/> other things: as it was ſaid of them, when they made an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, they laviſht gold out of their bags: but when they are to feed and cloath a poor member of Chriſt, then every penny is but like a drop of blood: but when are to lay it out for this or that gallantry, then men laviſh it out: Oh the foolery of ſome among us! Conſider what is it you labour for? that is your treaſure: What do you lay out your money for? ſee how ſtrangely people will for that they place their chief good in; how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they are to labour and to lay out themſelves for it. The Iſraelites were to make a Calf, and then they gave Ear-rings and Jeweis for it from their ſons and daughters: And that old Woman, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. 2, 3.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41800:47"/> that had ſcraped together 1100. pieces of ſilver, &amp; curſt him that had ſtoln it: Oh my ſon, ſaith ſhe, I have dedicated it from thy hand to make a graven Image; it was nothing to part freely with when it came to make an Image; thus where men place their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and chief good, where their treaſure is, there is the main of their labor, there is their great care, and for this they are willing to ſpare no coſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, would you know where your treaſure is, upon what do you live? examine from whence do the comforts of your life come in; that is your treaſure: It is called <hi>The food of the ſoul, the meat that periſhes,</hi> and <hi>the meat that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures to eternal life,</hi> that is, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41800:47"/> by which the ſoul lives, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>They eat the bread of wickedneſs, and they drink the wine of violence;</hi> all the comforts of their life come in by ſin: now examine by what the comforts of your life come in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 20. <hi>He feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon aſhes,</hi> ſpeaking of men who had the comforts of their lives come in by idolatry: the curſe of the Serpent is come upon them, they feed upon aſhes; by what do the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of your lives come in? I have a good eſtate, I have a plentifull Table, and herein all the comfort of my life ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Whereas another man ſaith, I have incomes from God, and have in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, fellowſhip with him: I taſt the conſolations of the Holy Ghoſt, and this I do in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41800:48"/> Sermons, and Ordinances, and therefore I wait upon them. Look wherein the comfort of your life lieth, there is your treaſure laid up. Theſe are plain Rules if you deal ſaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and plainly with your ſelves, you may eaſily know it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, what is it that is your greateſt care to keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things in the world, ſure that is your treaſure; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are commonly hidden, becauſe men would keep them ſafe; called therefore <hi>treaſures of darkneſs, Iſa.</hi> 45. 1. Now take a man that makes riches his treaſure, and what doth he fear moſt? why, leaſt they ſhould be taken from him by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: and a man that makes God and grace his treaſure, he fears Satan and ſin moſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41800:48"/> his great cate is to keep theſe: therefore thoſe that would rob him of theſe, he fears above all other enemies in the world. Another man that makes pleaſure &amp; wealth his care, I would not ſaith he be deprived of my wealth and pleaſure for a world: let ſin come, and Satan come, and take away his God, his grace, his ſoul and all, he is not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; theſe the man takes no care to keep: therefore that which is your treaſure, it is your main care to keep.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, what doth your ſoul retreat to for comfort in trouble, in any danger or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs when a mans ſoul is put to the retreat, whither do you retire? as if a rich man at any time be in danger, whither doth he retreat? <hi>The rich mans</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41800:49"/> 
                     <hi>wealth is his ſtrong tower,</hi> Prov. 18. 11. Let a godly man be in danger, whither doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat? to the name of the Lord; <hi>The name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower; the righteous runneth to it, and is ſafe,</hi> and thither he retreats and is ſafe. <hi>Haman</hi> was in danger, and under diſgrace; what doth the man bear up his heart with? he goes home and told of his wealth and the multitude of his children; here was the treaſure of the man: to theſe his heart retired upon this occaſion; and with theſe he comforted himſelf. And ſo it is, let a man be in diſgrace, I have ſuch an eſtate, and am deſcended from ſuch Parentage; with theſe poor ſouls bear up themſelves: but now another man, though none follow Chriſt but the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41800:49"/> poor of the world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible men, what does he comfort himſelf with: juſt as <hi>Tertullian</hi> anſwered thoſe that reviled the Chriſtians, they came of no honorable paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, <hi>At genus &amp; proavos ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent in Coelis,</hi> ſaith he. In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they have a Country, a Kingdom in heaven, though they be but poor here; and ſo <hi>Job:</hi> God had taken away all his eſtate and his children: now whither doth he retire? <hi>Job</hi> 19. 28. <hi>The root of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in me:</hi> I have a treaſure of grace in my ſoul for all that: what is a mans treaſure, that he retreats unto upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, look how you judge of other men; for you value men more or leſs, as they have of that which you account
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41800:50"/> your treaſure: a godly man that makes Grace his treaſure, when the queſtion is, who is the beſt man, the rich man or the godly man? truly ſaith he, the godly man is far the better man to me, though poor and contemptible in the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>They are the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ones, in whom is all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:</hi> here is a godly poor man, and there is a great Lord, but the godly man is the beſt man of the two to me, becauſe he hath more of that which I account my treaſure: tis ſo in other things: men that make wealth their treaſure, their chief good, let the man be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo wiſe and godly, if he be not rich, he deſpiſeth him; why? becauſe he hath not that which he accounts his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Another man that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41800:50"/> makes learning his treaſure, he ſaith a godly man, though never ſo godly, without learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a poor, ſimple, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning man, and that is all; he values all men according to that which he accounts his treaſure; examine what value you put upon men. Doſt thou prize a godly man above all the world? doſt thou ſay a Godly poor man is better to me then an ungodly King; tis a ſign that grace is thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for thou valueſt all other men according to that which is thy treaſure. The <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were reproached and deſpiſed with this, <hi>The poor men of Lions;</hi> but <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this world rich in faith,</hi> be they never ſo poor; by this you ſhall eaſily judge where your treaſure is: how do you value
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41800:51"/> other men? for you value them by that which you value your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, What be thoſe times that you ſet moſt price upon, that you write with red letters in the Kalender of your days? thoſe times that bring a man in moſt treaſure, thoſe times the man values moſt; as look to them <hi>Amos</hi> 8. they made wealth their treaſure; the Sabbath comes, it was a weariſom time to them, they took no pleaſure in the world in it; <hi>When will the Sabbath be gone,</hi> that we may ſell corn? as tis now with vain ones in the world, when will the Sabbath be gone, and the Sermon be done? we cannot take our pleaſures as at other times, that day ſeems ten to them. Look on the other ſide, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41800:51"/> there is one that cals <hi>the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath his delight:</hi> why ſhould the Sabbath be a delight to him, becauſe he looks upon it as the beſt day in the week, and moſt honorable, becauſe it brings in great treaſure. You never knew a rich man think the time long, ſo long as he is receiving of money; ſo tis with a gracious man, ſo long as he hath in-comes from God, theſe are Exchequer-days to that ſoul; thoſe times are moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to ſuch men which bring in that which they account their treaſure; now examine your ſelves by theſe Rules and deal faithfully with your ſelvs, and you will finde where your treaſure is: for where your treaſure is, there your hearts will be: and where your heart is, there is your happineſs; and rules
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41800:52"/> where your happineſs is, there is your good, and there your reward will be. There are five rules of trial which I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for this preſent time, which I deſire every one would take as a looking glaſs to ſee his face by, thereby to judge of his own eſtate, that you may know where your chief good is laid up, where your treaſure lieth. It is the greateſt inquiry in the world, there is not a greater queſtion to be askt in the world then this, Where is your chief good, where is your God? and therefore we had need ſtick a little the longer in it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt rule to judge it by, A mans treaſure or his chief good, is that which is firſt in his eye and aim in all things,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41800:52"/> in the whole bent and courſe of his life: that which hath the priority in all his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is his chief good, his treaſure. <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſervs, <hi>Intentio eſt voluntatis propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio ad bonum quoddam agendum aut fruendum.</hi> Intention is the bent and aim of the will, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto ſome good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto it by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; if it be a good to be affected, that rule takes place; that which is firſt in intention is laſt in execution; if it be a good to be obtained, then this rule takes place, That which was firſt in intention, is laſt in fruition: ſo that look now what is the great aim of a mans ſoul, that the bent of his heart is carried out after: the firſt thing that is in his eye, that is his chief good, his treaſure.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41800:53"/> In the Scripture you find that God ſtands very much upon priority. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Seek firſt the kingdom of God.</hi> Seek it firſt: why? is it not enough that the Kingdom of God be ſought, ſuppoſe it be in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place? no, it is not ſought then; it is deſpiſed, it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, if men do not ſeek it firſt. So likewiſe the Lord commended his love to us in this, <hi>he loved us firſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 19. So likewiſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 38. <hi>This is the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:</hi> God ſtands won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully upon precedency; ſo that that which ſhould be firſt, if it be not ſought for in Gods order, the Lord looks upon it as neglected, and not ſought for; for the Lord in this above all things elſe may be truly ſaid to be <hi>the God of Order.</hi> Take
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41800:53"/> a natural man, &amp; his chief good is firſt in his eie: it hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminency and precedency in all his actings and intentions.</p>
                  <p>Its the voice of all cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men in the world, Seek Godlineſs, ſeek Religion. I but <hi>quaerenda pecunia primum,</hi> ſeek an eſtate firſt: So of all ambitious men, ſeek honor firſt. Firſt ſeek to be great in the world; for a mans chief good is that which draws out the firſt intentions of his ſoul: the firſt born of his ſoul: ſee this in godlineſs: the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is plentiful in the proof of it: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. It is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle rule, <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſeek not or look not at the things that are temporal, but at the things that are eternal,</hi> on things not ſeen, and not upon things that are ſeen <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we aym
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41800:54"/> not. He ſpeaks it not only in his own name, but in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all the Saints: for all act alike in that reſpect, all have one chief good and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt end; for we make theſe things our aim; there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that we look upon by the by; but we look upon theſe things in the firſt place, as that which we make our aim: ſo <hi>Paul</hi> cals it, <hi>I preſs hard unto the mark,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is properly a mark at which a man ſhoots: properly that which a man aims at in ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: now you know when a man takes level, though there be many things at his right hand and at his left hand, that he may look at at another time: but when he levels he fixes his eye only upon the mark, thats the thing he only
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41800:54"/> looks at: the Apoſtle on the other ſide ſpeaking of other men, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 4. ſaith, <hi>Every man ſeeks his own things,</hi> that is, makes his own things his aim: this is the main thing they look at above all things elſe, they aim at: now ſee by this where a mans treaſure is, what his chief good is upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt. What is the firſt and main thing in all your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? If the Lord ſhould come to any Saint here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and make him <hi>Solomons</hi> offer, Ask what I ſhall give thee. It may be in reference to things below, they would not be preſently able to make choice: whether he ſhould chooſe riches, or honor, or poſterity, or long life or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among men: if all theſe were laid before him, the man
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41800:55"/> would not be preſently able to make choice: but there is no Saint in the world, if God ſhould ask, What ſhall I give thee? he would make anſwer without any diſpute and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the buſineſs, <hi>hoc primum in votis.</hi> This is my firſt deſire, an intereſt with thy ſelf, and an inheritance with the Saints: It would be no trouble to a godly man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it: in reference to the things of eternity there would be no diſpute; that which is firſt in intention, is laſt in fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: this is the firſt rule: pray examine your ſelves, what is the main intention of the ſoul ſet upon? what hath the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority in all your aims and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes? certain that is your chief good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a man ſhall know
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41800:55"/> where his treaſure or chief good is, by this: that is a mans chief good which he deſires for it ſelf, and deſires all things elſe in ſubordination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: thats a mans chief good which he deſires for it ſelf. Chriſt gives you this Rule, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 37. <hi>He that loves father and mother more then me, is not worthy of me:</hi> what doth Chriſt intend? a man is bound to love father and mother: but Chriſt ſaith, you muſt not love them more then me: what is that? When doth a man love any thing more then Chriſt? Truly then when it is beloved in competition with him, and not in ſubordination to him. He muſt love Chriſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: thats clear: Chriſt lays down that as a Rule: Chriſt is to be beloved for himſelf, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41800:56"/> God is to be loved for himſelf, and ſo likewiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. <hi>He that doth not hate father, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wife, and children, and his own life, cannot be my diſciple:</hi> hate them? how hate them? <hi>non abſolute, ſed compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative:</hi> A man is bound to love them all, and tis his duty; tis not to be underſtood abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in compariſon of the Lord <hi>Ieſus:</hi> ſo he is to ſee that excellency in him, that in compariſon of him he is bound to hate father and mother, yea and his own life: Why then Chriſt is to be loved for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and God for himſelf; and all things elſe are to be loved in ſubordination: nay if they do not come in ſubordination, they are to be hated: that rule is good always then that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> lays down, <hi>Deum diligere</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:41800:56"/> 
                     <hi>propter ſeipſum, amicum in Deo, inimicum propter Deum:</hi> God is to be loved for himſelf: We are to love our friends in God, and our enemies for God; then a mans chief good is that which a mans loves for it ſelf: but how ſhall I know whether I love God for himſelf: tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true a man may love God but out of ſelf love; and a man may love Chriſt but out of a principle of ſelf love; but how ſhall I know when I love God for himſelf, &amp; Chriſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; You ſhall know it plainly by two Rules. 1. That which a man is willing to part with all things for, that he loves for it ſelf; he doth love it above all things, part with all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ngs for it: But how ſhall I know when I am willing to part with all things for God and Chriſt?</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41800:57"/>
                  <p> There are two Seaſons wherein a godly man is tryed in this life; and never any man had grace in his heart, but he had two ſeaſons to try himſelf by; I ſay two, to ſay no more: at the time of his converſion, and at the time of his diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>At the time of Converſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 8. When <hi>Paul</hi> comes to be converted, put the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Paul,</hi> do you love Chriſt for himſelf? <hi>I account all things loſs that I may be found in him.</hi> Now he loves nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him; <hi>he that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes not all, cannot be my diſciple, Luke</hi> 14. 32. not actually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all, but in the diſpoſition of his heart he forſakes all for him. Indeed a godly man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes all for Chriſt at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: he forſakes all as a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41800:57"/> condition, that is, without this I cannot partake of him: For a man muſt ſell all if he will buy the pearl: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at converſion a man parts with all as a condition without which he cannot obtain it; but after converſion the man parts with all as an oblation. Doth the Lord require any thing as a Sacrifice? Will he have an <hi>Iſaac?</hi> the ſoul parts with all, and ſaith, he ſhall finde all in him again: he parts with all as a condition, and as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: for he knows <hi>he is not his own,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 28. All that he is, and hath, belongs to to him: thus at the time of converſion, a godly man hath experience, that he loves Chriſt and God for himſelf; for he parts with all for him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, at the time of his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41800:58"/> diſſolution, when a godly man comes to die, he ſees all things here below, taking their leaves of him; his friends, his eſtate, his glory, his pomp deſcends not after him: <hi>Naked as he came into the world, ſo he muſt go out again:</hi> now a godly man can look on all theſe with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, and ſay, I have no more need of them; <hi>for I am to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which is much the better, Phil.</hi> 1. 23. Conſider I pray then, a godly man hath a double experience that he parts with all for Chriſt, and for God at his converſion, and at his own diſſolution, and can do it with cheerfulneſs, juſt as that good Martyr, My wife and my children are dear unto me; ſo dear (ſaid he, when he came to die at the ſtake) that I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41800:58"/> could look upon it as a mercy to live with them, though in a priſon: but my Chriſt is dearer to me then all. Thats your chief good, thar you can part with all things elſe for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when a man ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts God and Chriſt, the good that is in them from all the good that comes by them, yet a man loves them for themſelves: abſtract and take away the good that comes by them, and the ſoul is carried after them for the good that is in them. I do not ſpeak this to favour that Antinomian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which ſays, that a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man in his obedience may not, nay tis their ſin to have reſpect to the recompence of reward: for <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſo, and Chriſt had ſo: the one for the glory ſet before him, the other
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41800:59"/> for the joy before him, <hi>omnis amor mercedis, non eſt amor mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarius.</hi> Its not every reſpect to the recompence of reward makes a man a mercinary in Gods ſervice; provided that it be in the ſecond place. Now you ſhall finde there are two ſeaſons, when all the good that comes by Religion and Godlineſs, ſeems to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from it; and what ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be thoſe?</p>
                  <p>The time of affliction, and the time of deſertion. Is there any outward benefit comes by Religion? the times of affliction and perſecution deprive men of that.</p>
                  <p>Is there any ſweetneſs, any inward comfort by it? the time of deſertion diſtracts and diſturbs that: nay when you look upon <hi>Iob,</hi> and ſee him
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41800:59"/> under both, under affliction and deſertion too: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding for all that, though a man ſay as <hi>Heman</hi> did, <hi>I am free among the dead, like thoſe that are buried, and thou remembreſt no more;</hi> for ought I know I ſhall never have good look from God more: yet I cry day and night: I have but little experience and hope of the good that comes by him, but my heart is carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him for the good that is in him: <hi>Though he kill me I will truſt in him.</hi> I will love him for the excellencies that are in himſelf, what ever becomes of it; this is clear and evident that he loves God for the good that is in him, and not for the good that comes by him: you ſhall finde it thus with men in this world; for I would inſtance
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41800:60"/> on both hands, thoſe that have their portion or treaſure here below; truth is they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with all things elſe for their treaſure; as take a man that makes riches his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; he will part with a good conſcience, he will part with the beſt friends he hath: nay let him act to the grief of his friends and unto the reproach of his enemies: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding if the man can obtain that which is his treaſure, it is enough: let his enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and his friends grieve, it is well enough, <hi>Populus mihi Sibilat, at mihi plaudo:</hi> the man will part with any thing; an Argument that the man loves it for itſelf: and ſo tis true with an ambitious man, that makes honour his treaſure and chief good, he will break all bonds
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41800:60"/> and obligations, natural, civil and religious, to obtain it, nay let him be accounted the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of men, let him be under Religious vows, he will break all theſe, he will deſpiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, tread upon friends, trample upon Laws, and all that he may be great: you ſee the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that men propoſe unto themſelves in this world, they love it for it ſelf, and will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any thing for it: this is the ſecond particular.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that which is a mans treaſure or chief good, he refers all things to it, he ſeeks all things elſe in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it; for a mans chief good, and utmoſt end, as the Philoſopher well obſerves, is that which orders all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but you will ſay, ſtill you put us upon a ſtrict inquiry;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41800:61"/> how can we tell that? When we ſeek all things, and love every thing in ſubordination to God: for this there are two Rules by which you may plainly judge.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he that ſeeks all things in ſubordination to his chief good, there is nothing ſhall croſs it; he ſeeks nothing that falls croſs unto it: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever falls croſs unto it, truly that is not ſought in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>Subordinata non pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> Now ſee this in a godly man: what ever may croſs him in that which is his chief good, to be ſure his ſoul goes off from it: as for example, ſuppoſe it be the love of life, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 24. <hi>I account not my life dear,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, ſo I may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh my courſe with joy.</hi> And ſo it may be, the body and bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41800:61"/> eaſe may ſtand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with duty. I cannot pray, nor I cannot faſt, nor I cannot ſpend my time thus, and ſo: Why, ſaith he, <hi>I beat down my body, and make it ſerve:</hi> I ſerve. Coming in competition with the chief good, it muſt yield. And ſo it may be an eſtate: I cannot part with my money, no; but if God be thy chief good, and thine eſtate come in competition with God and Chriſt, then <hi>valeat vita, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leat pecunia, valeant omnia:</hi> farewel life, &amp; farewel eſtate, and farewell all, as that good woman ſaid. This a man ſhall ſee, when he ſeeks all things in ſubordination to God; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe ſhall croſs that which is his chief good; and ſo if a man would gain the world, he ſeeks all things elſe in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41800:62"/> unto it: ſee an inſtance in <hi>Demas;</hi> will god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs abate his profit? no, it croſſes his chief good, and therefore he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes it; and ſo it is with all men, that do deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately chooſe ſinne to avoid ſuffering: or neglect a known duty for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral advantage: Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſomewhat elſe is their chief good, and the things of Religion are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to that; if any thing in Religion croſs my eſtate; or croſs me in point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then farewel Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it muſt ſerve it; that which is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to another, that muſt ſerve therunto: take a man whoſe portion is in this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41800:62"/> world, whoſe chief good is here below: there is nothing in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but muſt ſerve that man. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his chief good is his money, his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; now let me offer money to buy the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, that by this means he might make gain of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt: the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his eſtate. And ſo <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Reformation in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhall tend to this end, to ſettle <hi>Jehu</hi> in his Kingdom; for things ſubordinate muſt be uſeful to that to which they are ſubordinate; and if you look upon Popery in the whole frame of it, what is the aim and intention of it? Here is a great ſhew of Religion, all to keep the woman that rides the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41800:63"/> ſcarlet coloured beaſt on horſe-back, the greateſt ſhews and pretences to conſcience that can be: Now on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, take a godly man, whoſe chief good is God alone, why he doth value all things bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are ſubordinate to this end: an eſtate, what doth he love it for it ſelf? no, but as he may <hi>thereby lay up a good foundation, that he may inherit eternal life; as he may make him friends of the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Mammon: Gifts, doth he value them for themſelves? no, but for the edification of the body of Chriſt:</hi> ſo as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing elſe he makes ſubordinate to his chiefeſt good. <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 7. 11. <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is good with an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> by wiſdom is meant ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wiſdom, grace, that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41800:63"/> which begins with the fear of the Lord; but why doth he ſay, wiſdom is good with an inheritance; is not wiſdom good without an inheritance? there are two things in it: grace teaches a man how to uſe an inheritance, and to ſubordinate it; wiſdom is not ſo good in it ſelf, in reference to others, without an inheritance: and wiſdom teaches how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy an inheritance to Gods glory, and the good of others, to make it ſubordinate to a higher end; you love it no otherways then as it is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, you do not ſeek any thing to croſs it; but you make all things elſe ſerviceable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; if ſome of you ſhould go down into your own hearts, God hath given you honors and eſtates: do you love theſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41800:64"/> in ſubordination to God: how then is your honor and eſtate imployed for God? I am afraid many of us will be found ſeeking theſe things as our chief good, though we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that all is in ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, where a mans treaſure and chief good is, a mans ſoul goes out after it with continual and earneſt breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and gaſpings; whatever is a mans chief good, his treaſure, his heart goeth out after it, with continual and endleſs gaſpings and breathings: ſo you ſhall finde it with natural men, who have their treaſure in this life, their ſouls are full of nothing but luſts endleſs deſires: It is expreſt, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 24. 4. theſe be <hi>the liftings up of a mans ſoul to</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:41800:64"/> 
                     <hi>vanity:</hi> A man now that makes riches, or pleaſures, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, or any thing below his treaſure, or his chief good, he lifts up his ſoul to vanity: to lift up the ſoul in Scripture, is to deſire a thing earneſtly, with continual earneſt breathings after it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 15. <hi>The poor lifts up his ſoul to his wages,</hi> that is, deſires his wages, and <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 27. <hi>The Land whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you lift up your ſouls, to that you ſhall never return:</hi> So that to lift up a mans ſoul to any thing in the Scripture is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it earneſtly: thus if a mans chief good be here below, continual breathings and gaſpings of ſoul go out after it: but take another man now that hath his treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, his chief good above: where are the continual pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41800:65"/> and gaſpings of his ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 1. <hi>Lord, I lift my ſoul to thee: the one lifts up his ſoul to vanity, another lifts up his ſoul to God:</hi> there is none that I deſire in compariſon of thee, my ſoul gaſps for thee: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>For this we groan ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly;</hi> for our houſe which is from heaven, under continual groanings and breathings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. And though it is true, the ſoul while it is here finds an impoſſibility of enjoying God here: yet you ſhall finde this true, and tis a mighty ſpeech, Love that is of the right kind, and carried after God indeed, truly is never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied nor at reſt in this, that it is under a poſſibility of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying God, but works after, and tends to that enjoyment. Conſider it I pray; it is with the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41800:65"/> ſoul, as all waters you know run into the ſea: a tide may come and beat back the water at the preſent, but it returns after the tide, it returns to its own courſe: and ſo it is with a gracious heart, he can never be quiet; when the ſoul fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows hard after God, it is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten back again, but it makes after God again; now examine, what doth your ſouls breath and make after? that is your chief good.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that is a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and chief good wherein his ſoul receives ſatisfaction, without which he is never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; in the enjoyment whereof a man bleſſes his ſoul, that is, thinks it happy; ſo the Scripture ſpeaks this too <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 18. take a natural man, and <hi>While he liveth he bleſſes his</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:41800:66"/> 
                     <hi>ſoul:</hi> while he doth live to himſelf he bleſſeth his ſoul, ſo you ſhall finde that men are ſatisfied in nothing elſe. Take an ambitious man; let him have the wealth of Nations at command: let every mans purſe be open unto him; yet notwithſtanding he is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with all his wealth; for he cannot ſit in a low place: why? becauſe honor is his chief good.</p>
                  <p>Take another man and let wealth be his chief good: let the man be never ſo wiſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo learned, have never ſo great eſteem among men; he is not ſatisfied but he muſt be rich; for the ſoul is ſatisfied in nothing but that which the man makes his chief good.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man that makes God and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41800:66"/> godlineſs his chief good. In this he is ſatisfied, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in nothing elſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90. 14. <hi>Satisfie us early with thy mercy:</hi> take a ſoul that needs mercy, mercy ſatisfieth him, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 18. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe:</hi> Give him wealth, and that will not ſatisfie him; his ſoul is ſtill empty; honor and preferment among men will not ſatisfie him, tis not his chief good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 14. it is ſaid, <hi>a good man is ſatisfied from himſelf:</hi> what doth <hi>Solomon</hi> mean by ſatisfaction from a mans ſelf, it is ſelf joyned to a mans chief good; for a mans chief good is nearer to him then himſelf: take a man that injoys his chief good, though he be ſtript of all things elſe, he bleſſes his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41800:67"/> ſoul, he ſaith he is a happy man, for he is ſatisfied with himſelf; examine your ſelves now by theſe Rules: look what that is that is firſt and chief in your aim in all you do in this world; what that is that you love for it ſelf: what you love all things elſe in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to; where are the gaſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your ſoul, and in what is it that you bleſs your ſouls? Where is your ſatisfaction? by theſe tryals you ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know where your chief good is; and where your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is, there is your heart; and where your heart is, there is your happineſs, and there your portion will be at laſt; and ſo much for the Uſe of examination, how every man ſhall know; ſeeing every man hath a treaſure in this life, by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41800:67"/> election, though not by fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where his treaſure is.</p>
                  <p>The next thing that now we come to, is a Uſe of convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Hath every man that lives in this world ſome trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? or ſomething that may be called his chief good? why then this will ſet forth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, the moſt wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all thoſe that miſ-lay their treaſure, miſplace their chief good; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt tels you there are two ſorts of men; ſome whoſe treaſure is laid up on earth, others whoſe treaſure is laid up in Heaven. Some that have their chiefe good here below, their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this life: ſome it may be that have but the earneſt here, the firſt-fruits, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is to come: now all thoſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41800:68"/> that are miſtaken in reference to their chief good that do miſ-place their treaſure; This doth clearly diſcover to them that they are in a moſt miſerable condition: and truly this is, I will not ſay, the condition of moſt of you here preſent: but this is the condition of moſt in the world; that I am ſure the Scripture warrants me to ſay. Now that I may a little heighten this conviction, if the Lord pleaſe to bleſs it to any ſoul: When upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination you finde your chief good miſplaced, and you have not laid up your treaſure where you ſhould do: there are theſe ſix conſiderations that ſhould marvellouſly heighten it unto you.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider the Scripture doth ſpeak of a <hi>true treaſure,</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:41800:68"/> Luke 16. 11. <hi>If you have not been faithfull in the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, who will com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit to your truſt your true trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. When I read ſuch expreſſions in Scripture concerning riches, and ſee how ſtrangely men run after them, how mad men are of them, either unjuſtly gotten or unjuſtly kept, or wickedly ſpent, the Mammon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs every way: But who ſhall commit unto him the true treaſure? Now here is an oppoſition that clearly argues a diſtinction. There is a treaſure that is true, then certainly there is a treaſure that is falſe: it behoves you then to conſider, have I a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? is it true or falſe? as to that <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 21. Where wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is brought in, ſaying, <hi>He</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:41800:69"/> 
                     <hi>that loveth me, I will cauſe him to inherit ſubſtance:</hi> the word ſignifies, I will cauſe him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit ſomething that is, or ſomewhat that hath a being: what doth this argue? what do other men inherit that do not love wiſdom? truly they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit ſhadows: Take all the great-landed men in the world and they inherit a ſhadow. There is a true treaſure that is ſubſtantial: pray hear what the Holy Ghoſt ſaith of all your wealth, you rich men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not?</hi> what is that which is not? <hi>riches betake themſelves to their wings;</hi> riches is ſaid not to be; why not to be? it is all the being that many of you have in this world; if it were not for your wealth you were no body; its
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41800:69"/> the only thing you bear up your ſelves upon. Its ſaid not to be upon a double accompt; there is no reality in them, there is no ſtability in them; both theſe I think the Spirit of God expreſſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is no Reality in them, that is, in reference to what you fancy them to be; its more fancy that makes them ſuch things, then any reality that is in the thing in it ſelf; and in that reſpect <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs is idolatry,</hi> riches an Idol, and <hi>an Idol is nothing in the world;</hi> ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, that is, its nothing in ſubſtance: ſo riches is nothing of that which you fancy, tis not ſo in ſubſtance, tis but ſo in fancy; and there was never any godly man, whoſe eyes the Lord opened to ſee the vanity of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41800:70"/> the creature but he ſaw it was his own great thoughts made theſe things great: its your fancy makes them idols: And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is nothing of ſtability in them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to their wings: you think now to have them to morrow where they were to day, no, they take themſelvs wings and are gone; you have ſeen this in your time in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of inſtances, how mens treaſures take themſelves to their wings; in none of theſe things the true treaſure lies; he is a miſerable man therefore that doth not inherit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but fancies. Thou art a miſerable man therefore that art in this miſtake; thats the firſt Argument to enforce this conviction.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:41800:70"/>
                  <p> Secondly, conſider herein lyeth the great deceit of ſin and Satan, to deceive a man in his chief good. I, there is the great deceit, the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12, 13. Speaks of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin, <hi>Leſt any man be hardned with the deceitfulneſs of ſin;</hi> there is in every ſin a deceitfulneſs: <hi>It works with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and ſo the devil is ſaid to do with the deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs: Now ſin and Satan will labour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you in every thing; but to what end is it? <hi>In ordine ad ſummum bonum.</hi> It is in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to your chief good, there is the deceit; they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you in all things elſe, but in order to your chief good; for as the Spirit of God is in direction, ſo Satan is in delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41800:71"/> The Spirit of God in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he will direct a man in all his ways, in every courſe and paſſage of his life, but all in reference to a mans chief good and utmoſt end: ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will deceive a man in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſage of his life; but to what end is it? that he may deceive him in that which is his chief good; and in this the great malice of Satan doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that he will ſet a mans heart upon ſome particular good thing, which the ſoul ſhall take as its chief good: and embracing that, ſhall own the Devil as God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him. Pray conſider what I ſay, whatever Satan fixes a mans heart upon a particular good, and a man makes that his chief good, he owns the Devil as God, and worſhips
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41800:71"/> him as God: And it is in this that <hi>Satan was a murtherer from the beginning, Abbadon</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer: the devil deceived the woman: In what? in her chief good, and it is in this that he is the deſtroyer: and herein lies the happineſs of godly men, that though Satan deceives them in many things, yet in their chief good he doth never deceive them; they are paſt that: as he is never able to rob them of their chief good, ſo he is never able to deceive them there; that they are ſure of; therefore he can never deſtroy them: why? becauſe in their chief good he can never deceive them: able to deceive in this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act: they may be cheated by Satan of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this or that particular
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41800:72"/> grace: may be enticed to this or that ſin: may be cheat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by men of this or that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good: but in that which is their chief good they cannot be cheated.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider further, the nature of man doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly abhor to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: tis ſo in all your natures, men do not love to be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for there is not only a loſs in the thing, but a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment left upon the man: he is not only deceived of ſome good thing, but he hath the blemiſh of a fool laid upon him, becauſe he was deceived, being out-witted: you uſe to ſay, I had rather give away three times as much, then to be cheated of a ſmall matter: now you ſhall finde deceit is converſant about the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41800:72"/> and by this means a man is deceived through the failing of his underſtanding: The Holy Ghoſt charges, <hi>That no man ſhould circumvent and over-reach his brother:</hi> in bargaining men do not love to be over-reached: <hi>the woman was deceived,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>The Serpent beguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the woman:</hi> out-witted, over-reached, but never was there ſuch a cheat as this in the world, to deceive a man in his chief good, this is the great deceit: you will ſay, to give a man Braſs for Gold is a great deceit: for a man to take ſtones for bread, that were a greater; becauſe there is a leſs ſimilitude: but to take the Creature for the Creator, to ſet up the devil in the place of God: this is the deceit of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41800:73"/> being cheated in a mans chief good; there are tis true many leſſer deceits of Satan; he doth deceive men in this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act, and a man is many times deceived by Satan through the ſame ſin: when a man hath been convinc'd of a ſin, hath repented for it, hath prayed againſt it, coſt him many tears, and ſighs, and groans before God, and he hath reſolved againſt that ſin: yet a new temptation hath come, the devil hath varniſht that ſin over again, and the man is taken with it: this is a deceit in a particular act: but here lies the grand deceit, when a man is deceived in point of his chief good: the nature of man is exceedingly againſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beguiled, over-reached: conſider further,</p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:41800:73"/>
                  <p> Fourthly, you have the more reaſon to look unto it upon this account: becauſe this is the deceit that above all others Satan takes care to hide from you; he would ſo deceive you in your chief good, that you ſhould never know it, keep you under that deceit all the days of your lives. There are ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of Satan that may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to men, and they may recover out of them, as the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. ſpeaks of men <hi>recovering themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil,</hi> or as the word is, to come to a mans ſelf after he hath been drunk, to come into his wits again; a man may do ſo in many things: A man may ſee that in this or that action he erred and hath been deceived, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41800:74"/> that was not good, and this was not well; this a man may ſee and recover himſelf: nay, I think a man may go thus high, a man may ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Satan his guile in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his darling ſin, that I conceive even in a ſtate of unregeneracy, a man may change his darling ſin; a man may have ſuch diſcovery of the deceit of Satan; <hi>for the unclean ſpirit ſometimes goes out of the man;</hi> in reference to particular acts a man may ſee himſelf deceived, and a man may ſee himſelf quite <hi>eſcaped thoſe</hi> great <hi>errors</hi> among which he lives, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of a mans chief good whatever he can do to hinder a man from ſeeing the deceipt in his chief good, he will do, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>The God of this world</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:41800:74"/> 
                     <hi>hath blinded the eyes of them that believe not.</hi> What is the devils great deſign upon all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men? his great deſign is to keep them unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, thats his buſineſs; for never was any man converted to Chriſt, but he did ſee that he had erred in his chief good; for you muſt conſider what converſion is, it is a turning to God, that argues a departing from God: turn to the Lord, therefore we are departed from him. Now how is a man departed from God? Why, as his chief good, as his utmoſt end, and therein lies the true nature of all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I am departed from God as my chief good, and have forſaken God as my utmoſt end: when a man returns to God again what doth he do?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41800:75"/> why, change his chief good: that place is obſervable, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>My people have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted two evils; forſaken me the fountain of living waters:</hi> what is that? departed from me as their chief good from whence all good flows: <hi>And dig to themſelves broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns,</hi> that is, place their chief good ſomewhere elſe; that is the meaning of the Spirit of God; though a man ſee his particular error; yet in this he ſhall be blind; the God of this world will endeavor to blind his eyes: Further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this will be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit under which the greateſt part of the world will periſh, being deceived in a mans chief good. I ſay under this deceit the greateſt part of the world
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41800:75"/> will be damned; <hi>for ſtraight is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that enter thereat,</hi> Mat. 7. 14. Now all men it is very true are carryed out after ſome good thing or other, and that they purſue: <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Pſal. 4. but there is a fourfold deceit, under which about good things dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſought, the greateſt part of the world will periſh; pray obſerve them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, men take <hi>bonum appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens pro vero,</hi> that which is but a ſeeming good for a real and true good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they take <hi>bonum particulare pro univerſali,</hi> a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good for an univerſal good; that which is the chief good ſerves to all ends and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41800:76"/> purpoſes in all eſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; tis good every way: whereas riches, its true, they profit againſt poverty, but not againſt death and wrath; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour keeps a man from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, but will not prevail againſt ſin; and hereby men are deceived.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, men take <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porale pro aeterno,</hi> a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good, and they think this is an eternal good; they think their riches will laſt for ever, and that they will go down with them to the pit to bribe the flames, and corrupt the Tormenter. A mans chief good muſt laſt not only for this life, but in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, they take <hi>alienum pro proprio,</hi> that which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans good for their own:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41800:76"/> I thats the deceit. The holy Ghoſt when he ſpeaks of all things of this life, ſaith, <hi>If thou be not faithfull in that which is another mans,</hi> Luke 16. 11. I warrant there is never a rich man here, but thinks your eſtates are your own: a <hi>Nabal</hi> may ſay indeed, <hi>Shall I take my meat and my drink?</hi> and very thing is my and my; but the Spirit of God is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; he ſaith, Thou art the Steward of it for the preſent, but tis another mans; and therefore when he ſpeaks of giving to the poor, he ſaith, <hi>withhold not from him to whom it is due:</hi> you do not think it is due, it is at your own liberty; now here is the deceit, men take that to be their own good which is another mans: <hi>this worlds good:</hi> and under
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41800:77"/> theſe four miſtakes the greateſt part of the world periſh; they take that for a true good which is but good in appearance; for an univerſal good that is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; for an eternal, that which is but temporal; and that which is another mans for their own.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is this which will be unto Satan matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation; and if thou be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in thy chief good, it will be matter of deriſion to thee for ever; remember that: to Satan matter of inſultation: it is not with Cheaters as with Robbers, that take goods from a man by violence, but the Cheater boaſts of his pranks afterwards, to tell how he hath outwitted a man: ſo it is with Satan as a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and you know every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41800:77"/> is an inſulting evil, and <hi>Satan is the envious man:</hi> there are not only from Satan cruel murtherings, but there are cruel mockings: I pray do but conſider, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 10, 11, 12. there is <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> the devil ſet the greateſt good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him that this world could afford, to be the great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the world, and by this particular good the poor man is deceived: Well, he comes to Hell after all this; and <hi>the ſpirit beneath is moved at his coming.</hi> Do but ſee how the devil inſults, <hi>How art thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from heaven, Oh great Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer Son of the morning!</hi> Here is a man that I cheated, by varniſhing over a particular good: riches one, by honors another; by pleaſures a third: and it is that which will be to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41800:78"/> thee matter of deriſion for ever: it will be too late then to ſay, <hi>ſo fooliſh was I and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, I was as a beaſt before thee:</hi> then a man muſt own his own ſhame, and lie down under it: and this is the great and grand deceit which men will look upon with ſhame and confuſion of face to eternity. Certainly, you had need to take heed then you be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in your chief good: thus men are miſerable, whoſe chief good is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed.</p>
                  <p>But wherein doth their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie lie, that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place their chief good? There are ſix things; but it would ſpend a days time to reckon up the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of that man; I and a day would be too little to recount the miſery of that man
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41800:78"/> who erres in his chiefe good, errs in placing his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. There are only ſix things at preſent I ſhall mention, that whoever finds that his chief good is miſ-placed, he may conſider of it, and this may help towards his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion for the change of his chief good.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is nothing good to that man who errs in his chief good: its the old rule, <hi>Nil bonnm ſine ſummo bono:</hi> There is nothing good to that man who is deceived in his chief good: look into <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 3. there be riches: why, is not that a good thing? a good thing for a man to have a great eſtate and a large portion; but to a man that makes theſe his chief good, there is no good in them to him. <hi>There be riches</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:41800:79"/> 
                     <hi>kept for the hurt of the owners:</hi> the man ſhall wiſh one day that he had been as poor as <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he lay at the rich mans gate: the man is the worſe for them, he is but made rich for his hurt; and the ſame thing is true of honors and all outward things: many a man is made honorable to his hurt: for if he errs in his chief good, he errs in all things elſe.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a good thing to live under the means of grace, the preaching of the Goſpel, the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of the Spirit of grace in the Sanctuary, where he uſes to work? look into <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7, 8. there is <hi>the ground that drinks in the rain, and yet is nigh to curſing.</hi> Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he errs in his chief good:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41800:79"/> for what fruit hath he of all theſe? truly they all tend to no other end but to enſnare his ſoul, to draw out his luſts, to ripen his ſins, to haſten his ruine: here is all the good the man gets by it: <hi>as tis to a good man that hits right in his chief good, every thing is good to him: ſufferings ſhall be good, ſinning good, afflictions good, temptations good: Why, every thing is ſanctified to him: ſo on the contrary to another man, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is good to him, becauſe he errs in his chief good:</hi> As tis in order of cauſes, ſo tis in order of goodneſs too: all inferior things are never good to a man without an influence of the chief good: remember that is the miſery of a man that miſ-places his chief good, his treaſure: if he erre in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41800:80"/> that, nothing is good unto him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if a man err in his chief good, this will make him err in his judgement of things and perſons as long as he lives: that is his miſery, he never judges aright of things and perſons: the rule of every mans judgement is that which is to him his chief good: now if he err in that, he muſt needs err in his judgement both of things and perſons: Firſt,</p>
                  <p>You ſhall ſee he errs, and muſt needs do ſo in reference to things: Take a man whoſe chief good is here below, and ſee how he judges of things; he judges ſinning to be good, and <hi>therefore he chooſes iniquity ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then affliction,</hi> Job 36. 21. <hi>he judges the praiſe of men better</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:41800:80"/> 
                     <hi>then the praiſe of God,</hi> and therefore chooſes that, <hi>John</hi> 12. 43. nay <hi>he chooſes things preſent as better then thoſe that are to come.</hi> This is the way of a man that hath his chief good here below: he errs in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all things: whereas now tis contrary to a man whoſe chief good is in heaven: he ſaith, ſin is worſe then death, worſe then Hell: as <hi>Anſelm</hi> once profeſt, if hell were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the one ſide, and heaven on the other with ſin, he would rather enter hell, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that a good exchange; <hi>Mallem Gehennam intrare.</hi> And ſo he is not praiſe-worthy whom men, but whom the Lord commends: why does one judge of things one way, and another another way? tis becauſe of different chief
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41800:81"/> good: and as tis true of things, ſo tis true of perſons; one that places his happineſs here below, and hath his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this life, he calls the proud happy; judges them happy that be ſet up in this world, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 15. he ſaith, <hi>they are happy that be rich and honorable,</hi> and have all things in this world in poſſeſſion: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tis that wherein he places his chief good. Now ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man that hath his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in heaven, ſaith, <hi>they be the godly that be the excellent ones, the precious ones of the earth, the Lords jewels,</hi> and ſo they are in his account: for he judges of them according to his own chief good: and this is the true reaſon why the men of the world <hi>put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs:</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41800:81"/> becauſe the rule of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is their chief good, and a miſtake there makes them to erre: that is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if a man miſ-place his chief good, this will cauſe him to miſ-place all the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his ſoul all his life long: all the affections of his ſoul will be ſet wrong, and run upon wrong objects: the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe generation, crooked and perverſe: when all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoul are ſet wrong, and run croſs to every thing, they are ſo perverſe: now thus you ſhall find a man that hath his chief good here below, his treaſure on earth, he loves va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>He fears where no fear is, he rejoyces in a thing of nought,</hi> Amos 6. 13. all his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41800:82"/> affections are ſet upon wrong objects: why? they follow his judgement, follow that which he looks upon as his chief good; there be affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to that which is good in a way of proſecution, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to that which is evil in a way of averſion, and all theſe are ſet wrong; and all theſe follow that which a man places his chief good in: <hi>Other men fear man: a godly man fears ſin; the other rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in a thing of nought: but he rejoyceth in the hope of the glory of God:</hi> to his chief good his affections are ſet: and is not this a miſerable thing to have all the faculties of the ſoul diſ-joynted and ſet awry?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this makes a man to loſe his labour in every
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41800:82"/> thing he doth all his life long: if he err in his chief good, all his labour is loſt; every mans labor in this life is in reference to his chief good, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endures to everlaſting life:</hi> Now if a man miſtake and miſ-place his chief good, then all his labour is loſt; for that is the rule of all his labour: you will ſay it was a miſerable curſe, that upon the Princes of <hi>Zoar: they made Egypt to err in every work of their hands:</hi> as will you but conſider, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>the wicked works a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full work:</hi> why a deceitfull work? why becauſe the man is deceived in his chief good, and therefore their work ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver anſwers their labor; <hi>they weave a ſpiders web:</hi> but it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41800:83"/> becomes a garment: he that miſ-places his chief good, he is deceived in every work of his hands: he ſpends his parts, his time in vain: he ſows the wind, and reaps the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this only will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the man; oh conſider, this error only is the damning ſin: a man may be deceived in a particular good thing or action, and his ſoul be ſaved in the day of the Lord: there is not the beſt man on earth, but in many things Satan deceives him, &amp; in many things he may err and miſcarry: but if he be not deceived in his chief good, his ſoul ſhall certainly be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for all this. Now that which is your chief good here by way of election, ſhall be your chief good hereafter in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41800:83"/> way of fruition: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as tis in errors in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Doctrine: the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11, 12. ſpeaks of ſuch a <hi>man as holds the foundation, and builds hay and ſtubble upon it:</hi> that is, is deceived in doctrines of leſſer concernment; he ſhall loſe his labour, but his ſoul ſhall be ſaved for all that: ſo here in errors in matter of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, good things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; if a man err in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good thing, his ſoul may be ſaved; but if he err in his chief good, he will be deſtroyed; this is that which deſtroys the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, conſider if there were nothing elſe but this, it is the greateſt deluſion, and the abſurdeſt cheat that can be in the world: for a man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and makes that his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41800:84"/> happineſs, which is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; a chief good muſt have a quite contrary ingredient. It is obſerved by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that Bleſſedeneſs requires two things. Firſt, a chief good is that which cannot be loſt: now you place your chief good in things below; and Chriſt tels you, <hi>The ruſt and moth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, and thieves break through and ſteal:</hi> therefore to make them your chief good, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect cheat. Secondly, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs requires impeccability; the ſoul is put into a condition that it ſhould not ſin: Now whoever he be that miſ-places his chief good, even in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he lives in a continual way of ſinning; for tis ſetting up another God; he that places his chief good in any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God and heaven: for to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41800:84"/> be your God, and your chief good, is all one. In all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, ſee what a miſerable condition that man is in, who miſ-places his chief good: when his heart ſhould be on things above, he ſets it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things below. And thus much for the Uſe of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Lord ſet it on upon our conſciences. Do not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place your chief good, do not be cheated and befooled in that: for tis that deceit which is deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Is this a truth, that every man that lives in this world hath ſomewhat that he lays up as his treaſure? why then take Chriſts exhortation in the verſe before the text, <hi>lay up for your ſelves treaſures in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> that is the exhortation; if every man hath a treaſure,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41800:85"/> then lay up for your ſelves treaſure in heaven; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can come to open, there are three things that I thought neceſſary to premiſe before I come to preſs home the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation upon you. And pray mark, for they are very profitable things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſome do obſerve here <hi>praecepti ſuavitatem,</hi> the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſts commands: ſee how he applies himſelf to the deſires of a man: the Lord Jeſus notes this, that as man in outward things is a prudent, ſo he is a provident creature; man is not content to have enough for the preſent: he muſt lay up ſomewhat for time to come: the Lord Jeſus doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid this: here is ſweetneſs of the Command: if you will be laying up treaſure, I will
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41800:85"/> tell you where you ſhall lay it up to purpoſe, where you ſhall lay it up for time to come. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he tels you where is the true and the ſafe treaſure: you will be treaſuring; why then that you may not deceive your ſelves, lay up treaſure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. You have abundance of inſtances of this in Scripture; as for example, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. The 72. Diſciples are ſent forth to preach the Goſpel, and <hi>they return with joy,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>that devils were ſubject to them:</hi> Chriſt doth not forbid their joy, but rectifies it; ſet your ſelves to <hi>rejoyce in this, that your names are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And ſo men are prone to fear evil; he doth not reprove their fear, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 18. but <hi>fear him that can caſt body and ſoul into hell: I ſay fear him:</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:41800:86"/> he doth not forbid their fear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, but ſets their fear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right objects; and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo men are apt to glory in ſome excellency. Chriſt doth not altogether forbid their glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9 23. <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches, but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he underſtandeth, and knoweth me that I am the Lord.</hi> But <hi>let him glory in this that he knows me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is the ſweetneſs of all Goſpel commands: the Lord is pleaſed to fet them upon a right Object: he doth not forbid laying up of Riches, but be rich to God: he doth not forbid adorning and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41800:86"/> but ſaith he, <hi>be adorned with humility;</hi> love not the world, nor the things of the world, not abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad, but comparatively: only ſets it upon the right object ſtill. Thats the firſt thing I obſerve by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is obſervable alſo, that there are divers ways of treaſuring: the Text names two: ſome there be, their treaſures are on earth; and ſome there be whoſe treaſures are in heaven. But obſerving the Scripture, I finde there are three ſorts of treaſures among men: men do lay up treaſure three wayes, and in three places.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Theſauri in terra,</hi> men lay up treaſures upon earth, that is, they place their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41800:87"/> happineſs in the things below, they ſavour nothing elſe, they mind nothing elſe: look only to the things that are ſeen, and have no higher end in all their ways. Now theſe men, all their treaſure is upon earth. Its well obſerved by one, <hi>finis amatus &amp; intentus, theſaurus dicitur,</hi> that which a man doth love and aim at, thats his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for a mans chief good and utmoſt end are the ſame. Now men that have no End beyond this life, have no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure beyond this world, but all the projects of their lives they are terminated here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that look for nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the life that now is, only in this world; let me be rich and honorable, and let me live in bravery and gallantry while I am here; in this they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41800:87"/> pleaſe themſelves, and take this for their portion; now theſe are the men that lay up treaſures upon earth. But there are</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſauri in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henna:</hi> another ſort of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: ſome men lay up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in hell; you have ſuch an expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Thou, after the hardneſs of thy heart and impenitency, doſt treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath:</hi> Here is a man that lives in ſin: this man is a treaſurer too, but he lays up treaſures in hell: there is a treaſure of ſin, and a treaſure of wrath; and as the man<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adds to the one, God adds unto the other: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt know that as ſin doth ripen, ſo doth judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as ſin increaſes, ſo doth wrath, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 10. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41800:88"/> hath this expreſſion, <hi>The rod hath bloſſomed, pride hath budded,</hi> ſpoken of Gods bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath upon the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>3. <hi>Theſauri in coelo:</hi> There are a third ſort of treaſurers, that lay up treaſures in heaven,

                  </p>
                  <p>Do not lay up treaſures on earth, as contrary to treaſures in heaven; but lay up treaſures on earth, as they may be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                     <hi>Coelo neglecto,</hi> do not lay up treaſures on earth: how? that is ſo as to neglect heaven. Let not this be a means to take off your hearts from higher things: if it be your treaſure on earth, it is your curſe and plague: therefore look to it you whoſe eſtates take off your hearts from the things of God and eternity: God hath given you eſtates on earth: they are your plagues, your curſes, and yet how many poor ſouls do we hear ſay, as thoſe in <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Bleſſed be God, for they are rich.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

But rather as that poor wretch, that Cardinal ſaid, <hi>I would not leave my part in</hi> Paris <hi>for my part in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</hi> Now do not you thus lay up treaſures on earth, but lay up treaſures in heaven: and thus I have given you theſe Cautions for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the phraſe.</p>
                  <p>Let us now improve the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation that hath been laid before you, which was this, Seeing every man in this life hath a treaſure; ſome do lay it up upon earth, and ſome do lay it up in heaven: be you exhorted to lay up your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

                  <p>Firſt, what is meant by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and why we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to lay up treaſures in heaven?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what are thoſe treaſures that a man may have in heaven?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how can a man lay up treaſures in heaven, or what is it for a man to lay up treaſures in heaven, ſeeing no man in this world ever was in heaven? How is man ſaid to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41800:92"/> lay up treaſure there while he is in this life? how a man can lay up treaſure on earth, we can underſtand.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, give ſome Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to preſs and inforce the Exhortation on every one of us, as the Lord ſhall bleſs them unto us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what is heaven? what is meant by heaven?</p>
                  <p>And here I meet with a double interpretation, and we may make improvement of both of them, and therefore I ſhall give them both unto you; for all ſuch things tend to very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the opening of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

I have ſpoken a little of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, but give me leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it a little more unto you. There are great variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, what a mans treaſure in heaven is, and truly almoſt every Interpreter dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41800:95"/> ſome ſpeak of the word, ſome of the promiſes, ſome of graces, ſome of duties, ſome of alms: but we ſhall eaſily underſtand what muſt needs be meant, if you obſerve but the oppoſition; there is a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in earth, and a treaſure in heaven; what is a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on earth? that which ſtands in oppoſition to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure any where elſe: <hi>The man hath nothing elſe but what he hath on earth, then a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on earth is his chief good on earth, be it what it will:</hi> riches, honors, pleaſures, or whatever elſe: where his heart is, and his chief good, that is his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: then what is a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in heaven, with a mans chief good in heaven, thats his treaſure. Now what is a godly mans chief good in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41800:96"/> why, tis God, God is his portion, God is his reward, and Chriſt only as Mediator, as he brings him to God. Now there are three things that I ſhould point you to. Why none but God can be a mans treaſure in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a mans treaſure is that which he loveth moſt, and a man muſt love nothing more then God; nay a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and chief good is that which he loves with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love, that he can never have enough of, that he can never be ſatisfied with, that he never ſays I have enough. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews they have two words, that we uſe for treaſure; one is that which a man doth moſt ſet his heart upon; that which is unto him above all a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar. You ſee the word uſed,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41800:96"/> 
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>Iſrael is my peculiar treaſure,</hi> ſaith God, that is, a people that God ſet his love upon above all the people in the world beſides; that is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, where a man ſtays moſt; tis very true, where a mans love goes, there truly the man dwels, thats his treaſure, that carries out his heart. Now there being none in heaven the ſoul is to love above God, or equal with God; therefore he alone in heaven muſt be his treaſure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a mans treaſure is that, <hi>Quod maxime habetur in pretio:</hi> which he prizes moſt: and ſome obſerve upon this place, that is a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that he ſets the higheſt price upon. Now a man ſhould prize nothing more then God: ſo you ſee when God ſaith of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41800:97"/> his people, they are his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar treaſure: all people in the world are undervalued for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 4. <hi>I will give men for thee, and princes for thy life:</hi> Kings and Nations are nothing in compariſon of Gods people to God: In this reſpect, God is the treaſure of his people, becauſe they are to prize nothing in compariſon of him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God only is their treaſure, becauſe upon a mans treaſure he doth rely for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; and therefore thats the other word in the Hebrew which is put for treaſure, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 5. It ſignifies that which a man makes his refuge in all calamities and diſtreſſes: now when a Godly man is in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, whither doth he go? <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>The name of the</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:41800:97"/> 
                     <hi>Lord is a ſtrong tower, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous flie thither, and are ſafe:</hi> And in <hi>Davids</hi> diſtreſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee only?</hi> God is his treaſure. Now theſe three things are in a treaſure, that which a man loves moſt, and ſets the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt price upon, and that to which his heart doth retire, and ſeek ſupply from in all his wants, and every man muſt be ſupplied out of his treaſure, that I will tell you: Take a rich man when he comes to die, <hi>Riches avail not in the day of wrath;</hi> therefore God only is the Saints treaſure, and chief good: he lays up treaſure in heaven, and this treaſure is God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you will ſay unto me, God is in heaven already, it is the habitation of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41800:98"/> and glory. How can I be ſaid to lay up God in heaven, I that was never in heaven? the Lord he ever was there: how can I be ſaid to lay up God as a treaſure there? <hi>Tis very true, God was in heaven from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creation of heaven, that it hath been the throne of his glory; but he is not laid up there as thy treaſure, until thou cloſe with him. And no man, but he that hath the Lord for his God, can ſay, I have God for my treaſure:</hi> What ſhall I do then to lay up God for my treaſure?</p>
                  <p>There are ſix Rules that I ſhall give wherein this duty lies; and obſerve them, for they are the great duties of your lives, for we live in a ſcraping age: labour then to get the God of heaven for your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Why, how ſo?</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:41800:98"/>
                  <p> Firſt, he that will lay up treaſure in heaven, muſt chooſe God for his treaſure: no man hath a treaſure either in heaven or earth, but by choice. If a man chooſe riches, that is his treaſure; honors, that is his treaſure; if he chooſe God, that is his treaſure: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chooſe the Lord, as that which you prize above all things: this is the way to lay up God in heaven for your treaſure, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 22. <hi>You have choſen the Lord this day for your God:</hi> chooſe the Lord for your God, and you ſhall have God for your treaſure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you would lay up God for your treaſure in heaven, then you muſt part with all other things for him. All other treaſure (remember that <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 21.) See the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41800:99"/> terms, there was a rich young man that came to Chriſt, <hi>Chriſt bids him, go ſell all he had, and give to the poor, and he ſhould have treaſures in heaven.</hi> No man can have two trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, no more then he can be ſervant to two maſters; its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a man ſhould have two chief goods: you can never have God for your treaſure, leſt you part with all other treaſure for him. You that have other treaſures, do not tell me that God is your treaſure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ſoul is to be carried out after this treaſure inceſſantly: that a man lays up for his treaſure, which his heart is carried out abundantly after. <hi>Tell me you have a treaſure in God, and never groan and long after him, you have nothing to</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:41800:99"/> 
                     <hi>do with him; and therefore</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 22. There is none in earth I deſire but thee: <hi>Now how doth his ſoul go out after God?</hi> My ſoul pants after God as the thirſty land. <hi>Conſider with your ſelves, may be you can be content; I have a great eſtate, and I am raiſed from a mean man and a Prentice boy, and God hath given me a large eſtate, and I can bleſs his name for this,</hi> thanks be to God, for I am rich: <hi>But do you taſte no more ſavour in theſe things in compariſon of God then in the white of an egg?</hi> Can you deſire to part with all, that you may be with him? <hi>This is to lay up treaſure in God, to have the ſoul go out after him, and to him inceſſantly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if you lay up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in God, live upon your treaſure, live upon him. You
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41800:100"/> ſay often you live by faith; what is it to live by faith? To live by faith is to live upon God, who is the object of faith; therefore in all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of your lives have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to God ſtill; my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge is in God ſtill: what is your chief good? to that your ſouls will retire.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, what a man lays up for his treaſure, that he doth glory in, every man gloryeth in it: every man values all other men according to that he makes his treaſure; and he that fails of that, he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with an eye of ſcorn and contempt, be it what it will. I inſtanced before, a man that makes riches his treaſure: let a perſon be never ſo honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, wiſe and learned, he will deſpiſe him: and ſo a godly
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41800:100"/> man values himſelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his intereſt in God, and all other men according unto it: <hi>Tantus quiſque eſt, quantus eſt apud Deum,</hi> every man is no more worth then he is of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in Gods account; Chriſt doth ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3, 4. <hi>The Lord is my portion, the lines are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to me in a goodly place, I have a goodly heritage;</hi> the Lord is my portion: the Saints <hi>glory in God, and make their boaſt of him all the day long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, whatſoever is your treaſure, you muſt uſe all means that you may add unto it, or your intereſt in it: a treaſure is increaſed by continual addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whatever therefore may give a man a further intereſt in God, that is the way a man is to take, and ſell all to buy it:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41800:101"/> for he is to ſell all that buys the pearl, that which is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: as now it is the worſhip of God: <hi>the fear of the Lord is his treaſure,</hi> Iſa. 33. 6. by the fear of the Lord is meant the worſhip of God; why doth he lay up treaſure in the fear of the Lord? yes, he gets a further intereſt in God: why, are good works a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? becauſe God rewards a man according to his works, and he ſhall have a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God; and therefore the worſhip of God, and all the works of obedience, and the exerciſe of all grace, a man is buſied in all theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it adds to his treaſure, gives him a further inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him. Who is his God, and his al-ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:41800:101"/>
                  <p> Fourthly, and laſtly, to give ſome Arguments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Exhortation. Is there a treaſure to be had in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? and is it to be had in God? do not be ſuch enemies to your ſouls, as to neglect it: and that I may inforce this Exhortation, take with you theſe few Arguments, and pray mark them well. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, no treaſure below God will be laſting; there will come a time when all treaſure laid up below God, will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended; and what will you live upon then? the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>the world paſſes away, and the faſhion thereof,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 29. He uſes the expreſſion, <hi>the time is ſhort:</hi> whats the meaning of it, tis a Metaphor taken from things folded up;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41800:102"/> there is very little part of it left; it is come almoſt to the laſt fold: which may help a little to explain that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 10. <hi>Continue or draw out thy loving kindneſs to them that love thee:</hi> The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor may ſeem to be the ſame; that is, there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of love folded up: and but little winded off: there is an eternity to ſpend; but now for all theſe outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, there is a great deal worn out, and but a little more behinde: how many men have you ſeen already out-live them, but to be ſure they will out-live the lives of the beſt men: therefore remember no Treaſure below God will laſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider this, heaven is the place where you
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41800:102"/> hope to go: carry your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with you, or ſend them thither before you; there is no man will remove from a place and leave his treaſure behinde him; and poor ſoul, thou leaveſt a great eſtate and a fine houſe behinde thee, and thou hopeſt to go to heaven, and thou haſt no treaſure there: its the obſervation of one upon this place, Lay up treaſures in heaven, carry your proviſion, carry your treaſure with you, you hope to go to heaven, and if that be a true and lively hope, you would endeavor to lay up treaſure there.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider with your ſelves, if you lay up treaſure in heaven, as God is a true Treaſure, ſo God is a faithful treaſurer; what thou
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41800:103"/> doſt commit to him, he will keep ſafe: and he is a treaſurie able to ſupply all your wants, and to make you happy for ever; he is ſelf-ſufficient in himſelf; much more will he be al-ſufficient to thee; do not reſt in any thing that is below God, but lay up treaſure in him.</p>
                  <p>Nay, let me tell you further, and pray mark it, any treaſure here that is below God, if it be thy treaſure in this life, it will be thy tormentor in the life to come, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 3. ye have heaped treaſure together for the laſt day: he ſpeaks it of rich men, and he tells them, that <hi>they have laid up treaſure againſt the laſt day:</hi> there is a double interpretation given of it; ſome expound it of the laſt day of the world, the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41800:103"/> ſome of the laſt day, the end and period of the Jewiſh ſtate, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of, and St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>this is the laſt hour:</hi> I conceive it ſpoken of the Judgement coming upon the Jewiſh State: take it which way you will, the thing leaves us a clear argument; if you take it for the laſt day of the State, when judgements come upon perſons, or people: then, when judgements come, your riches ſhall be the greateſt plagues you have; but refer it to the laſt day of the world, riches then take their leave of a man, they ceaſe then to be treaſures, but they will be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors: the Apoſtle tels them, the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt them; they have heaped up riches againſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41800:104"/> the laſt day; take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <hi>Take this for a rule; That which a godly man hath wrought upon him at his converſion, that a wicked man is ſure to meet with at his deſtruction; that which was his treaſure before, he then looks upon as his greateſt plague and torment:</hi> as Ephraim, <hi>What have I to do any more with idols?</hi> and ſaith to his idols, <hi>Get ye hence.</hi> Look upon <hi>Iudas,</hi> his money was his treaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: when he comes to hang himſelf <hi>he caſts that away:</hi> and the word carries a great deal of diſpleaſure with it; this is the money that hath undone my ſoul, and ſo many a one will ſay, when he comes to die: the love of an eſtate, the things of this life, the love of pleaſure, or honor, this hath undone me for ever: when it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41800:104"/> ceaſes to be your treaſure, then it becomes your tormentor.</p>
                  <p>I have one word more; It is one of the great ſtudies of the times, what they may do now to keep what they have got, <hi>Non minor eſt virtus quam quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere partatueri.</hi> What ſhall we do to preſerve what we have got? Truly let me ſpeak plain unto you, the only way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our treaſures on earth, is to make ſure of this treaſure in heaven; thats the only way: pray look into <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 6. but <hi>in the houſe of the righteous is much treaſure; in the horn of the wicked is trouble:</hi> moſt commonly, <hi>the poor receiv the goſpel,</hi> moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, godly men are the pooreſt men: why, in the houſe of the righteous is much trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: truly the riches they have are precious, becauſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41800:105"/> they are the fruit of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and come in by vertue of the ſecond Covenant; and by this means they have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in them that other men have not: but Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> tranſlates the word, and it will fitly bear it: <hi>In the righteous mans houſe there is much ſtrength,</hi> as if he had ſaid, all the care of men is to keep what they have; and therefore provide to have it under locks &amp; bolts, and uſe all ways and means to preſerve it: but take a godly man that hath an intereſt in God, and is truly righteous, and can ſay, The eſtate that I have, I have juſtly gotten; This is a better way to preſerve it then all other means in the world; therefore would you preſerve treaſure on earth? la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get an intereſt in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41800:105"/> in heaven: And to this end <hi>make you friends of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Mammon;</hi> that you may have a greater intereſt in God the true treaſure.</p>
                  <p>And for a concluſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, you that have not God for your treaſure here, you ſhall never have him, if you have no intereſt in God for your treaſure in this life; for after this life a mans chief good doth never change: What was thy treaſure ſhall ever be ſo: thou haſt a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but if it be below God, it ſhall be thy tormentor: A mans eternal eſtate is caſt here; and being ſo, that which was a mans chief good, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo to him; and therefore fear before God: if thou haſt not thy treaſure laid up in God in this life, he will never be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41800:106"/> thy treaſure and reward: and yet in the life to come, God will be all in all, and that God thou haſt then no intereſt in; for as a man ſows here, ſo ſhall he reap hereafter. I know not what to preach to you that ought more to affect you. And ſo much for this Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Lay up treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is one Uſe remaining of this Doctrine, and tis of Conſolation to all the Saints of God. You have ſeen the miſery of thoſe that erre in their chief good; Give me leave now for the comfort and ſupport of the hearts of Gods people, to ſhew them their happineſs in this, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are in this world, yet in regard of their chief good
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41800:106"/> they have not miſcarried.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh bleſſed ſoul, that haſt not miſ-placed thy treaſure, that doſt not err in that which is thy chief good! I confeſs a godly man is every way a bleſſed man; he is bleſſed in regard of the pardon of his ſin.</hi> Bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and whoſe ſin is covered. Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. <hi>He is bleſſed in regard of the diſpoſition of his ſoul;</hi> Bleſſed are the pure in heart, bleſſed are the meek, bleſſed are thoſe that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; <hi>He is bleſſed in all the ordinances:</hi> Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 84. 4. He is bleſſed in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; bleſſed are they that are undefiled in the way, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41800:107"/> walk in the Law of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 1. <hi>Nay he is bleſſed in his expectations,</hi> Iſa. 30. 8. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that wait for him; <hi>He is bleſſed even in affliction:</hi> Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, and teacheſt out of thy Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 12. <hi>A godly man is therefore every way bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi> But wherein lies the top of his bleſſedneſs? the height of it lies in this, he is bleſſed in his chief good, there is the top of all his bleſſedneſs unto which all theſe things are but inferior and ſubordinate.</p>
                  <p>Conſider I beſeech you, look to the Angels of glory in heaven, the elect Angels they are bleſſed in their inward qualifications and indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their wiſdom, their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, their power, their zeal; they are bleſſed likewiſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41800:107"/> of their office and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, they are principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers imployed by Chriſt in ordering things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; <hi>miniſtring ſpirits; the ſpirit of the living Creatures is in the wheels:</hi> they are bleſſed in their activity in thoſe offices, <hi>they go and come like lightning,</hi> its the prophets expreſſion, <hi>Ezek</hi> 1. 19. but wherein lies the top of their bleſſedneſs: truly in this, they have pitcht aright upon their chief good, they have not erred in their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>Nay the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf as Mediator, he was every way bleſſed: <hi>he is the heir of all things:</hi> he is one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to glory, and a glory ſuitable to the ſervice that he did perform, which neither man nor angel was able to do:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41800:108"/> but wherein lies the top of the bleſſedneſs of the Mediator? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>The Lord is my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaith my ſoul:</hi> Its the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators ſpeech, his bleſſedneſs lay in his chief good: the ſame thing is true of the glorified Saints in heaven; <hi>the ſouls of juſt men are made perfect.</hi> Reckon up what you will of the glory of the ſoul, or the glory of the body that remains after the reſurrection, when <hi>they ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the kingdom of the father:</hi> yet this is the top of all; they have pitcht upon the right chief good.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary what is the miſerie of the Devil and thoſe damned ſpirits in hell? Pray conſider what I ſay to you; tis very true, there is nothing wanting to make them miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41800:108"/> if you look upon their ſinfulneſs, you muſt conſider, in Hell <hi>(peccatum etiam habet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem poenae)</hi> and ſin there is a puniſhment: why if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider likewiſe the bottomleſs pit, the burning Lake, in which they are ſhut up, <hi>held in chains under darkneſs:</hi> all this I ſay makes them miſerable; add to all theſe <hi>the worm of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that is ever gnawing:</hi> for ſo tis in all thoſe damned ſpirits: why, all this you will ſay muſt needs make them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry miſerable: but what is the top of their miſerie? wherein doth that lie? It lies in this, I have erred in my chief good: tis <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> expreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: put ten thouſand hells together, here is the worſt, there is none like this, that I have forſaken God, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41800:109"/> God hath forſaken me; I have hated God, and now the Lord hates me: put ten thouſand hels together, there is moſt in this: here indeed doth lie the top of their miſerie: as this was the height of their folly.</p>
                  <p>But what needs ſo long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating upon this, you will ſay? Why,</p>
                  <p>Truly becauſe as I would ſpeak comfort to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: ſo I would have them conſider rightly of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts propoſed; for there are many grounds of comfort to the Saints, and they may make uſe of them all, and they are to do it in their ſeaſon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their order: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that which is the great comfort ſhould be in the firſt place, even in reſpect of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41800:109"/> taking comfort: that which is the great ground of comfort, that the ſoul ſhould moſt of all take comfort from. Now tis in reference to comfort, as it is in reference to duty; there are many commands, and all of them are to be obeyed: but yet there are great commands, and theſe are to have the firſt place in our obedience; <hi>This you ought to have done, and not to have left the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So there is variety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, but there are ſome great grounds of comfort, and theſe are to have the chief place in our hearts, and from theſe in an eſpecial manner ſhould our comfort come in. As there be ſome grand promiſes; thoſe three I have often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:41800:110"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>I will be thy God:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thats the bottom of all the promiſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will give thee my Son:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will ſend my Spirit:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great Comfort ſhould come in from the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: and ſo tis here: and pray obſerve it. If a man be much in the leſſer duties of Religion, and neglect the greater, he hath juſt cauſe to ſuſpect the truth of his obedience. So if a man take much comfort from leſſer grounds, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the greater, he hath great cauſe to ſuſpect the truth of his comforts, and his right to them: This is the great reaſon why I preſs it ſo earneſtly, that as I would have the people of God take their portion in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſo I would have them take it in an orderly way.</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:41800:110"/>
                  <p> But now let us come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, Why is a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man ſo happy in this, that he hath not erred in his chief good? There are ſeven grounds of the greateſt comfort that I know in all the book of God, ariſing from this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have not miſ-placed my treaſure, my treaſure is in heaven, I have not erred in my chief good: And the firſt is this.</p>
                  <p>Hereby the ſoul may ſee the riches, as well as the freeneſs of the love of God, that in my chief good I have not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried: This is the great error of the world, they do miſ-place their treaſure, and by this means, <hi>they have their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this life only;</hi> &amp; with <hi>Dives their good things here:</hi> Now is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41800:111"/> this the great error of the world, as it will be found to be at the laſt day: is it a great mercy to be delivered from leſſer ſins and judgements? how much more is it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that which is the greateſt judgement in the world? Did <hi>Noah finde grace in the ſight of God, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that deluge that ſwept away the world of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly?</hi> To miſplace a mans chief good is the greateſt ſin and greateſt judgement that can poſſibly fall upon a man. <hi>This is delivering a man to Satan</hi> indeed: delivering to Satan with a witneſs: The Scripture ſpeaks of a double delivering of a man to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: There is, <hi>Traditio Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanae tanquam Domino, &amp; tanquam lictori:</hi> delivering
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41800:111"/> a man to Satan as a Lord, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a man to Satan as an Executioner, as an Officer.</p>
                  <p>There is delivering a man to Satan as a Lord, ſo the Lord Jeſus delivered <hi>Judas</hi> to Satan by the ſop: <hi>After the ſop the devil entred into him,</hi> that is, as a Lord to rule over him.</p>
                  <p>But there is another way of delivering to Satan, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>When you are met together in my Spirit, deliver ſuch a man to Satan:</hi> How is that? <hi>for the deſtruction of the fleſh:</hi> when the Lord ſhall be pleaſed in an Ordinance to give over a man ſo to the power of the devil, that he ſhall afright his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and terrifie him for ſin committed; and for that end this means ſhall have its due work and power upon the man: but in this Satan is but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41800:112"/> an executioner: A man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver delivered up to Satan, as a lord, untill he be given up to him, ſo as that he ſhall deceive him in his chief good, then the devil is the lord of the man. When the Lord delivers a man to Satan, ſo as that the devil cheats him in his chief good; then the man is delivered to Satan as a lord. Now for a godly man to be able to look into his own condition, and ſay, when I look abroad in the world, and ſee one man place his chief good in this, another in that; one in riches, another in honors, another in pleaſures; but in the midſt of all theſe, though in many things I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry: and therein <hi>I was as a beaſt before God;</hi> yet bleſſed be his name, here is my comfort, I have not miſcarried in my
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41800:112"/> chief good: there is not any thing ſtays the ſoul like this: when a godly man is in the greateſt affliction: when he comes to look death in the face; nay, when Satan ſhall triumph over the moſt of the world, as he will do; for as he is ſubtle, ſo he is envious, and therefore an inſulting ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: when he ſhall inſult over moſt in the world, then that poor ſoul ſhall be able to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all the powers of darkneſs: Its true I am weak indeed, and I am ignorant, poor and mean, and low in the world, yet in this the devil can never deceive me: through grace I have ſo far <hi>obtained mercy,</hi> that the devil is never able to cheat me of my chief good: herein will lie the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at the laſt day, herein will
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41800:113"/> lie a mans glory; for tis a mans chief good that will be his glory, or his ſhame to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; herein will be his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or folly to eternity: do you not remember that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>ult. Mary hath choſen</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the better part,</hi> or <hi>the good part.</hi> I ſhall not inquire what the meaning of that is the good part; but the word there uſed, ſignifies not only <hi>partem ſed portionem,</hi> part but portion: <hi>Mary</hi> hath choſen that good portion: and herein lay her wiſdom; in a mans election his wiſdom lieth: And above all choice in the world, is that which he makes his chief good: true ſaith the ſoul, I have bin fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh in many things, &amp; in many things I have erred; but yet bleſſed be the name of my
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41800:113"/> God, the true treaſure was not hid from me.</p>
                  <p>And when a man ſhall come to appear before men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels at the laſt day, thoſe that are now the fools of the world; that are derided for their godlineſs, that are mockt in their choice, as men that are not able to ſet themſelves in the face of the times, ſo as to be ſome body in the preſent Age. But when they ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Lord Jeſus <hi>to judge the quick and dead</hi> in his Kingdom, then theſe will be eſteemed of all others the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe men: this was the ſoul that was directed by wiſdom from above, that carried him ſtill to the right chief good: if this will not ſtand by you in your greateſt troubles, there is nothing in Religion will do it.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:41800:114"/>
                  <p> Secondly, There is this ground of comfort, I have choſen the true chief good, the true treaſure, that ſhall never be taken from me. You know the expreſſion of <hi>Maries</hi> better part, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>ult. She hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the better part, that ſhall never be taken from her:</hi> there is no man miſcarries in his treaſure, but he that lays it up below: what ever a man lays up as treaſure here below, he will loſe; it will be taken from him: for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt tels us, <hi>Here is ruſt and moth,</hi> and here are <hi>thieves that break through and ſteal; omnes damni cauſae ſignificantur.</hi> One upon that place ſets down all the ways by which men may loſe their treaſure; whether they be from cauſes within, or cauſes without, from thieves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41800:114"/> violence. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> one of the great robbers of the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>he robd them of their treaſure;</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there is a principle of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in themſelves; there is a moth that will come out of the fineſt garment, a Ruſt that will breed out of the pureſt gold; from within he ſpeaks it of all treaſure men lay up in the Creature, whatever is a mans treaſure below. <hi>For all the creatures came under mans Covenant, and the Covenant with man being broken; all the creatures fall under the curſe. Obſerve it, tis a great truth, and by this means curſes the ground from whence all this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in a mans treaſure below doth come,</hi> they all periſh with the uſing; but here is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a man that hath his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41800:115"/> true treaſure laid up <hi>where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruſt nor moth, nor thieves can come:</hi> tis an excellent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that of <hi>Auſtin. Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum nec invitis confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, nec invitis aufertur.</hi> A mans chief good, its given to no man againſt his will, but by a mans own choice, and taken from no man againſt his will; the true chief good ſhall not: your good things here below are taken away againſt mens wils: men will loſe their riches, and their honors, and their pleaſures will vaniſh into ſmoke: but now this chief good it is liable to no violence from without, to no decay within, and therefore its an excellent obſervation of the ſame Father, when he ſpeaks of the aſſiſtings of ſaving grace, what kinds of helps
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41800:115"/> go with ſaving grace.</p>
                  <p>It is, ſaith he, they do cloſe with good, and do it ſo as no oppoſition ſhall overcome them. <hi>No oppoſition.</hi> And when they have cloſed with it, no oppoſition ſhall take it from them; I, that is Almighty power indeed.</p>
                  <p>Why then comfort thy ſelf in this, Tis true I have little in the world, and I ſee other men abound in riches and honors, and <hi>they waſh their ſteps in but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>bathe in rivers of oyl.</hi> But I can look beyond all theſe: if their chief good be in this, it will be taken away from them: but bleſſed be the name of my God, I have a chief good that cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from me; theſe are the great ſtays of the ſouls of Gods people.</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:41800:116"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, hath a man cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the true treaſure? from hence he hath alway ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to guide his way: from hence he hath alway ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reduce his wandrings. Let me ſpeak to them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from his chief good he hath the guide of his way; tis the rule of the Schoolmen, <hi>Summum bonum eſt omnis opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis origo.</hi> It is a mans chief good that is the foundation of all the actions and motions of the ſoul, from whence ſtill it hath his ſpring; this is to the ſoul as the center is to the ſtone: you know the ſtone moves towards its center, &amp; it will go the direct way if it be not hindred: what guids its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? why the center: ſo what guids the motions of all godly
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41800:116"/> men? the chief good, thats their center, &amp; they move towards it continually: <hi>ſo that if a man want a particular rule, yet this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule will be a mighty guide unto him.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>a mans cleaving to God, Acts</hi> 11. 23. <hi>Following hard after God:</hi> Why, what is that? truly Religion doth conſiſt in the cleaving of the ſoul to God, and a conſtant following after God: in this Religion lies: Now what is the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation in all the ſouls mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? what will bring me neareſt to my chief good? and its the chief good ſtill that is the guide of all its motions. You have an expreſſion which here comes in fitly to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 22. our Saviour ſaith, if thy eye be ſingle, thy whole body is full of light:
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41800:117"/> if thy eye be ſingle, <hi>Auſtin</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, <hi>Intentio animae eſt animae oculus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the intention of the man in what he doth, that is the eye of the man: Why then, a ſingle intention is a ſingle eye; as a double eye is an eye that is carried after a double object, that is carried partly after God, and partly after the world: a double eye and a double heart, they one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound another; but a ſingle eye is that which looks purely upon God: now what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath this upon a mans whole life, the whole actions of thy life? for that is meant by the body here: as the light of the eye guids the body, ſo the intentions of the ſoul guide the way: now all a mans acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be full of light: <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:41800:117"/> 
                     <hi>acceptable to God, well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him.</hi> How comes it to paſs? Why a ſingle eye guids him. I pray conſider it well: this is a mighty comfort to the people of God, that in many caſes I want a particular rule; and a godly man many times, though he be well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scripture, may want a particular rule: what carries him directly to his chief good, will be a great guide to a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mans way. <hi>As in thoſe great points of Socinianiſm and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm, wherein the depths of Satan are ſo much ſeen, though a Chriſtian be not able to anſwer many of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: yet here's one Rule will carry him through all: That Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which exalts God moſt, and abaſes man moſt, is true Doctrine: Certainly that doctrine which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:41800:118"/> 
                     <hi>man, &amp; puts al the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God upon the will of man, is falſe. This general Rule will carry him through the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</hi> Tis ſo in reference to a Chriſtian way; That which carries me directly to my chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, that is the guide of my way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, and ſo it hath a great influence to reduce a mans wandrings: the truth is, the beſt men that have choſen God for their chief good, yet many times depart from him. <hi>We all as ſheep have gone aſtray:</hi> Now what ſhall bring a man back again? why he eyes the chief good; juſt as it is with a Traveller that intends to go to ſuch a place; he looks in the Map which muſt be his way; he looks firſt to hs journeys end, and obſerving the paſſage
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41800:118"/> he ſaith, This is too much on the right hand, and that is too much on the left: juſt thus is the caſe of a godly man: God is my chief good, there is my aim: Now I erre on the right hand, and now on the left hand; but where doth he take that which reduces him? Still thats his chief good; obſerve <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>They ſhall hear a voice behinde them, ſaying This is the way, walk in it.</hi> Here is the voice of the Spirit, that is truth: by the Spirit this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the man. Now you go from your chief good, this is not the way to heaven, this ſhall never bring you to God; they are wonderfull comforts to a godly man; and there is not any thing can be ſpoken that is a more glorious guide, and a more effectual way to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41800:119"/> reduce a man, then this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I depart not from that which is my chief good: That is the third particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Unto a mans chief good his ſoul retires, and from it he fetches comfort upon all occaſions; for he that hath made choice of the true chief good, is able to ſay, I am ſure here is ſolid comfort, which other men now cannot, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 10, 11. <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong tower:</hi> the <hi>name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower:</hi> they are put in oppoſition: now whether do men retire in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? to their chief good: the rich man to his wealth, a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man to the name of the Lord; ſo that in every trouble every man goes out for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to his chief good: <hi>Now a</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:41800:119"/> 
                     <hi>godly man is able to ſay in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, Tis true, I have no riches to comfort me, and very few friends to ſtand by me: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding for all that I can retreat to my God my chief good: there is comfort enough in him. I have a God, a Chriſt, a Heaven, a new Covenant, and a new Image; theſe I can retire to upon all occaſions, where I am ſure there is ſolid comfort. In this caſe that ſoul dares compare his chief good with all the men in the world, at ſuch a time no man knows but he that feels it, how a ſoul triumphs in his chief good: juſt as the Spouſe,</hi> Cant. 5. 10. My beloved is the chief among ten thouſand: <hi>I, let all the men in the world bring out their treaſure, I dare compare with them: for,</hi> There is no rock like our rock; who is a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41800:120"/> God like our God? <hi>The Lord is his treaſure: its a ſtrange place,</hi> Pſal. 44 8. 22. <hi>compare them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> ver. 22. For thy ſake are we killed all the day long: <hi>all the day long nothing but kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: now what is their condition under this?</hi> ver. 8. We make our boaſt of God all the day long: <hi>kill'd all day long, and yet brag of God all the day long; and yet this is the condition of all the Saints of God.</hi> See the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all other treaſures; when men retire to them, their ſouls are empty; but in my chief good there is ſolid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to be had whenever I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this is a very great comfort to a godly man, even in the midſt of all his failings. Pray take notice of it, and the Lord ſet it on upon the ſpirits
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41800:120"/> of thoſe to whom it belongs; yet I have attained to chooſe God for my chief good: true, the beſt men may and muſt ſay, <hi>Who hath made his heart clean?</hi> and when they look back upon their ways, they muſt acknowledge, My heart hath run out inordinately, ſometimes to this and that creature: and I have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeek after him who is my chief good, my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and for this I deſire to be aſhamed before him all my days: yet notwithſtanding, my happineſs is laid up in him alone; there is my treaſure: <hi>David</hi> comforted himſelf thus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 21. <hi>I have not wickedly departed from my God:</hi> departed he had, departed weakly, nay many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted wittingly, bur wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41800:121"/> I have not departed. What is it now for a man to depart from God wickedly? the meaning is this, tis for a man to place his chief good ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe; <hi>to go after another God,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. I thank God I have never done ſo; I have choſen the Lord for my chief good, and to that choice I ſtand: though many times weakly and willingly I have departed from God, yet wickedly I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did: tis a great ground of comfort in the midſt of all the failings of Gods people. And truly there are no things in this world ſo great troubles to the people of God, as their departings from God are; they be their great troubles: as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks of ſin in reference to his accompt,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41800:121"/> and he profeſſes, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: my ſin, ſaith he, this is death, and this is Hell: I, ſin is; and therefore departing from God is their great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet here is their ſtay, and their comfort, I never wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly departed from God; and I have never choſen any but thee.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That which a man doth chooſe as his chief good here, and lay up in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by election, that he ſhall certainly enjoy hereafter by fruition: what is here thy cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen good in election, that ſhall be thy chief good by fruition hereafter: for as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Beatitudo electione inchoatur, adeptione impletur:</hi> A mans bleſſedneſs begins in election here; what a man chooſes for his chief good, ſhall be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41800:122"/> and perfected in fruition hereafter; and therefore what a man chooſes for his treaſure in heaven, that which he hath choſen, he ſhall enjoy; do you not remember the promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>I will be thy exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great reward?</hi> doſt thou chooſe God for thy chief good here? he will be thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding God hereafter: what is thy Good here byſtipulation, ſhall be thy chief good here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by viſion, fruition by union: there is a mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I have a chief good in heaven, I am ſure I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, which is the top of bleſſedneſs, he that hath laid up his chief good in heaven, is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with the ſame happineſs that God is: he is called</hi> the bleſſed God: <hi>why? wherein doth Gods</hi>

                     <hi>bleſſedneſs conſiſt? Truly it lies in this, in the enjoyment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; his chief good lies in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he is his own chief good, for the enjoyment of himſelf as chief good: herein lies the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of God: then for a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to enjoy God as his chief good, ſo far as a creature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, he is bleſſed even with the happineſs of God; thou doſt here live the life of God, and art made conformable to the Image of God: thou art bleſſed with the happineſs of God,</hi> and hereafter ſhalt enter into the joy of thy Lord: theſe are the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that are great grounds of comfort to all thoſe that have laid up their treaſure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>the true Treaſury.</hi> And ſo much for the firſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41800:123"/> ſecond general obſervation, which is this:</p>
                  <q>The treaſure is attractive of the heart; and whereſoever a mans treaſure is, it will carry his heart with it.</q>
                  <q>For wherever the treaſure is, there the heart will be.</q>
                  <p>Four things there are which I muſt ſpeak unto by way of Explication, which are indeed as ſo many ſubordinate Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in the Text: they will all tend to the opening of this great point.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to ſhew what is meant by the heart: that, by heart in Scripture is meant the whole ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the ſoul of man, the heart goeth out of it ſelf for happineſs, for its chief good; for here is treaſure laid up either in heaven or earth;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41800:123"/> the heart goeth out to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: the chief good of a man is without himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a matter of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great concernment, where a mans heart is placed: thats the Argument that Chriſt uſes here, <hi>Lay up treaſure in heaven:</hi> Why, what matter is it where ones treaſure is? Why, where your treaſure is there your heart will be.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the heart doth always follow the treaſure: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the treaſure is, it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily infallibly carries the heart; and then we ſhall give the Reaſons of this laſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to which all the reſt are but ſubordinate.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what is meant by the heart; or if you will, take it in a Propoſition: The heart of man in Scripture is put
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41800:124"/> for the whole ſoul.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrews generally place the Government of man in the heart, and make the heart the ſeat of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoul: ſo you ſhall finde the Scripture commonly ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>1. If you look to the whole ſoul as corrupt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperatly evil: who can know it?</hi> And,</p>
                  <p>2. If you look upon the ſoul as ſanctified; for as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption goes through all the faculties, ſo doth ſanctification alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 4. <hi>He that hath clean hands and a pure heart,</hi> which is called <hi>The hidden man of the heart,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 4. <hi>And with the heart man believs, Rom.</hi> 10. 10. I conceive thats the whole ſoul, and all the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41800:124"/> faculties collectively. But by heart in Scripture alſo is ſometimes meant thoſe things, <hi>quarum ſedes eſt in Corde,</hi> which are ſituated, and have their habitation eſpecially in the heart: as wiſdom is attributed to the heart, <hi>wiſe in heart: Ephraim is a ſilly dove without a heart,</hi> without wiſdom, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 11. <hi>He that truſts in his own heart is a fool,</hi> Prov. 28. 26. His own heart, that is, he that leans to his own wiſdom, or as the Scripture elſwhere, <hi>he that is wiſe in his own eyes.</hi> So likewiſe you finde the heart put ſometimes for conſcience, and the actings thereof; <hi>Davids heart ſmote him</hi> when he cut off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment; it is ſpoken of the conviction of his conſcience. Sometimes it is put for the memory, the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41800:125"/> treaſury of the ſoul; <hi>Mary laid up all theſe things in her heart.</hi> But in this place I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there are three things eſpecially intended by heart here by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the thoughts, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, the conſultations of the heart; where the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is, there is the heart. In this are all the meditations, the thoughts, the plottings, the contrivances of the ſoul, they are where a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 5. 25, 26. The Prophet ſaid to his ſervant <hi>Gehazi, Went not my heart with thee, when thou wenteſt out after the man?</hi> How did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets heart go with him? that is, his thoughts went; for the thing was diſcovered unto him by a prophetical ſpirit; and that is indeed a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41800:125"/> choice expreſſion, <hi>Job</hi> 17. 11. <hi>where the thoughts of the heart are,</hi> in the Hebrew, <hi>called the poſſeſsions of the heart.</hi> Now whatever you poſſeſs here with your bodies, tis true indeed the body can ſee the glory, and taſt the ſweetneſs in many contents: but what do your ſouls poſſeſs in all theſe? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the thoughts; what the ſoul poſſeſſes, it poſſeſſes by thoughts, and therefore they are called the poſſeſſions of the heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the heart here is meant, I conceive, the love, deſires, the longings of the ſoul: for in theſe the ſoul goeth out towards its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: ſo <hi>Sichem, Gen.</hi> 34. 8. <hi>His ſoul clave to Dinah, Jacobs daughter:</hi> ſo <hi>Davids heart went out to Abſolom:</hi> therefore
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41800:126"/> where your treaſure is, your love is, your ſoul goeth out in all manner of longings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, by the heart is meant a mans delight, that wherein the great comfort of his life lieth, wherein it is laid up: It is ſaid by Chriſt, <hi>though a woman in travel hath anguiſh, yet after ſhe remembers no more the pain, for joy that a manchild is born into the world:</hi> and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 20. Theres a woman delivered of a ſon, and <hi>calls his name Ichabod:</hi> She regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not; for ſhe did not ſet her heart, that is, took no comfort in him. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 10. <hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them,</hi> that is, do not place all the comforts of your lives in theſe things. Let not your hearts be ſwallowed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41800:126"/> up by theſe, as if you had no better things: thus then by heart is meant the whole ſoul, but in this place eſpecially, the thoughts, the love, the joy and delight: I ſhall afterwards take up theſe things again more particularly. I now only endeavor to open it, thats the firſt Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the ſoul of man goeth out of it ſelf for happineſs; his treaſure is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelf: It is Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour only, and his prerogative; his bleſſedneſs is in himſelf; his bleſſedneſs is himſelf: he is unto himſelf the chief good: he hath nothing without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that makes him the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God: neither is he moved by any thing out of himſelf. When the Mediator ſpeaks of all he did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. he ſaith,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41800:127"/> 
                     <hi>My goodneſs extended not to thee:</hi> its true the L. Jeſus as Mediator in all his obedience, added no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the bleſſednes of God, his bleſſedneſs is in himſelf: And here note two things that I ſhall lay before you.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, man hath not a chief good in himſelf, his happineſs is not within his own power: he is therefore in reference to all things, a dependant Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Hence the people of God, who have made choice of the Lord for their treaſure, God in Chriſt, they ſay, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? My ſoul is athirſt for God, for the living God: my ſoul pants after God, as the thirſty-land:</hi> thus then the ſoul is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtleſs: why? becauſe it ſeeks to joyn it ſelf to its chief good which is without it ſelf:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41800:127"/> and as for that place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 14. where its ſaid, <hi>A good man is ſatisfied from himſelf:</hi> the meaning there is not ſelf as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from God, but ſelf as united to God; not ſelf in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but ſelf in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God: its true indeed a mans chief good may in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect be ſaid to be the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate part of himſelf; that of the Schoolmen is true ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſelf united to God: <hi>Deus eſt intimior nobis intimo noſtro,</hi> God is nearer to us then our ſelves. So the man is ſatisfied, that is, goes not out to any thing beſides God: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a mans treaſure is without himſelf, his chief good lies not within his own power.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is the nature and conſtitution of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoul to make out to a chief
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41800:128"/> good without it ſelf: its true indeed moſt of the world mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake this chief good, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place it; but yet this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature of the reaſonable ſoul, to go out for ſomewhat as treaſure out of it ſelf; this was the very nature of it in the Creation: it hath this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with every creature, not only to ſeek its own preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but its own perfection: this is the condition of every creature, but much more of the reaſonable creature, becauſe it hath not a fountain in it ſelf, therefore it muſt go out to draw: becauſe it hath not food at home, therefore it muſt go out to buy: the greateſt part of the world indeed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake it, and place their chief good in hell, when they ſhould place it in heaven: but yet
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41800:128"/> every one goeth out to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, and ſaith, Who will ſhew us any good? It is the obſervation of <hi>Auſtin, Anima quae vivit ad infimum vivit mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſere: ad ſummum beate.</hi> Man is a middle creature, and hath ſomething above him, and ſomething below him: that ſoul that hath its chief good below it ſelf, is a miſerable ſoul, whatever it is. But here is the happineſs now of the Saints, their chief good is above themſelves, but it goeth out of themſelves ſtill: Chriſt ſpeaks of the food of the ſoul, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 27. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but for that which endureth to everlaſting life:</hi> the ſoul goeth out of it ſelf for ſomewhat to eat and drink; there are hungrings and thirſtings; for its proviſion is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41800:129"/> not in himſelf: therefore the ſoul that lives upon ſome what above it ſelf, that lives bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 24. <hi>he feedeth upon aſhes, &amp;c.</hi> the man was ſeduced by the Serpent, and the Serpents curſe is upon him. All the comforts to which his ſoul goeth out, all is feeding upon aſhes, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal is ſaid, in his abſence from his father, to feed upon Husks. Let me point at that place before named, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 10. If <hi>riches increaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them:</hi> as it is with inſenſitive creatures, herbs and plants, they put their mouths into the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th, as the Philoſopher ſaith, ſo do they here, <hi>apponere Cor:</hi> that as they ſuck the ſap and juyce, the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment that is proper to their natures: ſo take a man whoſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41800:129"/> heart goeth out to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he ſets his heart upon them, that from thence he may ſuck ſomewhat for his preſervation and perfection. And this brings me to conſider of that place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 11. <hi>they ſhall lament for the teats, the fruitfull fields, and the pleaſant vineyards:</hi> lament for the teats, what is the meaning of that? <hi>Forelius</hi> indeed, and ſome others expound it, <hi>pro lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,</hi> for the children that ſuckt the dug. But Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſome other Interpreters do underſtand theſe teats figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively: The teats were the fields and the vineyards, and at theſe they ſuckt, and by theſe the happineſs and the comfort of their lives came in. Now ſaith God, I will cut off, and dry up the teats: you read
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41800:130"/> the ſame Metaphor, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 11. <hi>They ſhall ſuck, and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of conſolation:</hi> This then is a truth, that the happineſs of man his treaſure is not in himſelf: but he doth naturally go out to ſomewhat without himſelf: only I ſay indeed the greateſt part of the world they do miſtake therein. Now give me leave before I paſs this ſecond particular, to ſhew you the folly of ſucking dry teats: to let you ſee the miſerie of thoſe men that ſeek happineſs, and go out of themſelves for any treaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God: Doth the heart of man go out for treaſure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally? Oh the miſery of thoſe men that go out of themſelves for any treaſure below God! Conſider but theſe three things.</p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:41800:130"/>
                  <p> Firſt, conſider you draw where there is no water: the creature is but vanity, all things below God are: you ſuck where there is no milk, all theſe things are empty: and thats one great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                  <p>But there is another which heightens this wonderfully: and that is, the more your ſoul goeth out to theſe things for its treaſure, the more the appetite is increaſed, but never ſatisfied: For I told you, its true, all the creatures below came under mans Covenant in the Creation, and by that means came under mans curſe in the Tranſgreſſion. Now there is this curſe come upon all the creatures ever ſince the Fall, they enlarge the appetite but never ſatisfie them. Now
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41800:131"/> you would ſay this were a ſad curſe upon any man in the world: ſuppoſe it ſo ſtill in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things: that the more he eats and drinks, the more hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and thirſty he is: therefore luſt in the Scripture <hi>is compared to drunkenneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, conſider further yet, hereby you become ſubject to your own ſervants; he places his chief good in that which God hath given to ſerve him. The height of iniquity lieth in this, when a man commits adultery with his own ſervant: God gave him the Creature to ſerve and uſe, and he will have them to enjoy: tis the height of a mans miſery.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, conſider in the laſt place, what is there to be had in theſe, when your ſouls are gone out to them? Look to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41800:131"/> 
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 13. a known place: <hi>My people have forſaken me, the fountain of living water, and have dig'd to themſelves broken ciſterns that will hold no water:</hi> Me thinks that very Scripture ſhould wonderfully keep off the heart from going out to creatures for happineſs, for his treaſure; pray conſider there be two things in it to be opened.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, all the good in the Creature is but water in a Ciſtern; what doth that imply? why firſt,</p>
                  <p>It implyes this, it hath no good in themſelves, they have no more then is put into them: Ciſterns have no more water then is put into them. God can put a great deal of good into a creature, that is true, but ſtill remember, it is but a Ciſtern.</p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:41800:132"/>
                  <p> Secondly, a Ciſtern is of ſmall compaſs, it will hold but a little: a man may <hi>ſee the end of the perfection of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> we cannot ſay ſo of the Fountain: Beſides,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is water that will die, in reference to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſo commonly uſed of <hi>living water;</hi> they will not be lively refreſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, they will all leave you: for they be <hi>broken ciſterns; the world paſſes away, and the faſhion of it.</hi> But now,</p>
                  <p>What is water in the fountain? treaſure laid up in God: Why? it is in a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is originally in him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a continual Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it is always running.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is in him inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtibly,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41800:132"/> never drawn dry.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is in him communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; a fountain gives out water, and doth it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, comfort in God is living comfort; the water in the Fountain is <hi>living water:</hi> in theſe reſpects you may ſee the miſerie of that man, whoſe ſoul goeth out for treaſure to any thing without God: thats the ſecond general propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Every mans treaſure is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a matter of great concernment in Chriſts accompt, and ſhould be in ours where our hearts are: why, <hi>Where your treaſure is, there your hearts will be.</hi> Give me leave to open this unto you.</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:41800:133"/>
                  <p> The Lord in the Scripture hath given ſpecial direction for the ſetting of a mans heart; therefore that a mans heart ſhould be right ſet, is a matter of great conſequence, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Set your hearts upon your ways:</hi> ſo tis in the Hebrew; <hi>And if riches increaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them:</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 46. <hi>Set your hearts upon all the words of the Law:</hi> But why is it ſo? Truly there are very great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it: that every one may look down into himſelf, and ſay, where is my heart? As,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is the heart mainly that God looks upon and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves where it is: in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner the Lord eyes the heart; you know in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>God looks not as man looks:</hi> man looks to the appearance, God looks to the heart, and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:41800:133"/> 16. 9. <hi>His eyes run to and fro through the world to ſet himſelf with thoſe whoſe hearts are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right:</hi> tis a matter of great conſequence therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on your hearts God ſets his eyes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is the heart mainly that God claims and cals for, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 26. <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart:</hi> this is indeed the habitation of the great King: and when the Lord hath taken the heart to himſelf, he hath the man: nothing is <hi>Corban,</hi> a fit gift for God, unleſs the heart be firſt given.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, where the heart is, there is the man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the ſoul is gone, the man is gone; where the heart goeth the man goeth: it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 38. 10. he ſpeaks it of a mans days, and ſaith,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41800:134"/> 
                     <hi>they are ſoon cut off, and they flie away:</hi> they leave the body behinde, but the ſoul is gone: ſo that where the heart goeth the man goeth. Now do but look how the Lord obſerves the goings out of the heart. <hi>There were men that came to hear the Prophet preach,</hi> Ezek. 33. 31. Their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs; <hi>and the truth is, my brethren, wherever the body is, yet the ſoul is with the object upon which it is ſet.</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſpeaking of the happineſs of the people of God in this world, ſaith, <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma frequenter aſcendit, &amp; currit per plateas coeleſtis Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Their ſouls be in heaven, their bodies be upon earth: The ſoul goes to heaven, and viſits the Prophets, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes the Patriarchs and the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41800:134"/> Angels, nay the ſoul cloſes with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in glory; he ſaith, <hi>There is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing that the heart hath, even there where the body cannot come:</hi> Therefore obſerve, where the heart is, there is the man: its matter of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence then, where you ſet your hearts: Nay further yet,</p>
                  <p>God values every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his heart, and every man is worth as much as the treaſure is upon which the heart is ſet, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 20 <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth:</hi> Why? becauſe his treaſure is little worth: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that upon which his heart is ſet is worth nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 27. <hi>A man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is of an excellent Spirit;</hi> and <hi>my ſervant Caleb had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:41800:135"/> 
                     <hi>ſpirit:</hi> God values men according to their hearts, and their hearts to what their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is: There are two things that commend the heart to God, that make it of value in Gods accompt; their orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the objects of the heart: <hi>The ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price: let the inner man of the heart be ſo adorned,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 4.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially the objects of the heart, thoſe things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the heart is ſet: tis therefore of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for a man is worth no more then his heart is worth, and the heart is worth as much as the object upon which the heart is ſet; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is matter of great
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41800:135"/> conſequence where you ſet your hearts, becauſe from your hearts all your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flows, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Keep thy heart above all things:</hi> take heed what that goeth out unto: why? <hi>from it are the iſſues of life:</hi> whatever flows forth in a mans whole life, flows from the conſtitution of the heart; for <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaks; out of the heart proceed murders, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, fornications,</hi> and the like. Look to the ways of your hearts, and ſuch will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ways of your lives be. Then it is of great moment upon what a man ſets his heart; if the treaſure did not carry the heart with it, it would not be ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, and pray obſerve it,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41800:136"/> for it is the ſpecial thing that I ſhall preſs in this point: it is of great conſequence where you ſet your hearts, and upon what: becauſe the objects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the heart is ſet have a transforming power, and do mightily faſhion the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves: you know in the 115. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> what is ſaid concerning <hi>Idols</hi> there; <hi>they that made them be like unto them, and ſo are all that put their truſt in them:</hi> becauſe that on which the heart is ſet, frames the heart like it ſelf; that look as where your treaſure is, there your hearts will be: ſo like your treaſure your hearts will be: as I would a little inſtance in thoſe men that have their treaſure in this life; let us ſee how it faſhions their hearts. Its ſaid of <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> from whom
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41800:136"/> the Lord in diſgrace took one ſyllable of his name away, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>Thy eyes and thy heart are for thy covetouſneſs:</hi> and thats the condition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, they have nothing in their hearts, but how they may either get or ſave, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs lies much in them both: nay unjuſt keeping is many times an act of greater covetouſneſs then unjuſt gain: now what does God ſpeak of that man? look afterwards to the 29. <hi>ver. Oh earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord; write this man childleſs:</hi> there are many interpretations given of it; among the reſt, this is one: the man was wholly earth, he was faſhioned to it, and therefore the Lord calls him by the ſame name. <hi>Its that which I intreat you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve:</hi>

                     <hi>the loſs of the ſoul, and the gain of the world common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go together: therefore Chriſt puts them together</hi> Matt. 16. 26. What ſhall it profit a man to gain the world, and loſe his ſoul? <hi>Why is there a neceſſary connexion between theſe two? not neceſſary indeed, but a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous connexion: it is a hard matter to gain the world, and not to loſe the ſoul:</hi> but the ſoul is not only loſt hereafter, but even here in this life; becauſe its framed and faſhioned to the object upon which the heart is ſet; as I ſhall give a few inſtances, that you may the better underſtand me.</p>
                  <p>Take but thoſe two glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencies of the ſoul, the light of it, and the purity and holineſs of it; now let
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41800:137"/> the heart be ſet on any worldly thing, and the ſoul is loſt in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in regard of the light of it, that the heart can ſee nothing that is ſinful-evil: can ſee nothing that is ſpiritual-good; for the ſoul in the light of it is loſt, being ſet on worldly things, they cloſe the eye of the ſoul: and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 37. <hi>Turn away mine eyes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vanity:</hi> he ſpeaks of the vanity of the creature: and ſo long as mine eyes are ſet upon theſe, ſo long I ſhall never ſee the Spiritual excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of God; I ſhall ſee the excellency of ſpiritual things when my eyes are turned away from theſe worldly things, it ſpoils the ſoul and

It is ſaid to be ſo upon a double ground, <hi>ab origine,</hi> all evil comes from thence as the root: all evil is nouriſht by it as the root; there is no ſin that wil not flow from this principle; there is no ſin that this principle will not nouriſh: as give me leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in 2. or 3. things, that if the Lord pleaſe, it may be an engagement to you to take heed, where you ſet your hearts</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, There is no ſin that this will not frame the heart to: It will make a man lye with</hi> Gehazi; <hi>commit Sacriledge with</hi> Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>and</hi> Saphira; <hi>rob God with them,</hi> Malachi 3. 8. <hi>Curſe the</hi>

                  <p>Nay further, it will make a man reject the offers of grace out of knowledge, and the good things of the Goſpel out of contempt: take heed of it.

I pray conſider of theſe few particulars, that you may ſee what transforming

                  <p>Firſt, every man in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate eſtate hath ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant luſt, and this luſt is ſaid to be predominant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the enjoyment, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that luſt, therein lies a mans treaſure: by that a mans treaſure or chief good comes in: now hence it comes to paſs, every man hath ſome predominant luſt in the days of his unregeneracy, called <hi>the ſtumbling block of a mans own iniquity,</hi> Ezek. 7. 19. the Fathers uſe to ſtile it <hi>Peccatum in deliciis,</hi> the ſin of delight, or a mans darling ſin: <hi>Job</hi> calls it <hi>a mans ſweet morſel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41800:144"/> that any luſt is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants? for there be ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile luſts: its true every ſin rules over the man, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſin there be ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile luſts; the more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately any luſt converſes with a mans treaſure, the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate his treaſure comes in by it; according thereto is the predominancy of the ſin, though in an unregenerate man every ſin is raigning, <hi>the whole body of death:</hi> yet there is one ſin that is as it were the Vice-roy, in whom the body of ſin doth reſt, and that is grounded purely upon this conſideration: the ſin that brings in a mans treaſure; that wherin the ſoul places its chief good, and wherein it takes full delight and contentment, to which he makes all other
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41800:145"/> ſins ſubſervient; This is the firſt demonſtration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſinne that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes immediately with a mans treaſure, and brings it in, that is the predominant luſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond demonſtrative Argument is,</p>

                     <hi>ſpoken, and I deſire the Lord to ſpeak it to my heart and yours: there is no man doth periſh that ever did make a profeſsion of Religion, but it is when he meets with this ſtumbling block of his own iniquity, that I dare preſume to ſay: Never any made a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion, and fell away and periſht, but he did ſtumble at his darling ſin, there he brake his neck, becauſe where his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was, his heart goes after it:</hi> Thats the meaning of that place of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. Its ſpoken of the ſtony ground, <hi>It received the ſeed and ſprung up, and bore fruit:</hi> how came it to paſs that theſe men fell away? what undid them? there was <hi>an opportunity of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,</hi>

                     </gap>: <hi>In the opportunity of temptation they fell away:</hi> every temptation
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41800:146"/> doth not come in the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: when is it then? truly, the opportunity of temptation is then, when a man is tried in his maſter luſt; in this is the predominant evil, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withhold his heart from his treaſure; the heart is gone out to it; and thats the reaſon whenever he is tempted in that ſin, he can make leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and he is certainly at laſt foiled, and overcome for ever. Thats the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative Argument of the truth of this point.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it will appear that the heart goeth out to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, becauſe in the purſuit of it the heart is impatient of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and procraſtination; it can bear no denial, it can bear no delay. Firſt it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of oppoſition, <hi>Prov.</hi>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:41800:146"/> 17. 22. <hi>It is better to meet with a Bear rob'd of her whelps, then a fool in folly:</hi> What doth <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> mean? who is the fool according to the tenor of that book? every unregenerate man: but is the fool ever out of his folly then? you can never meet him out of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: I conceive the meaning of it is; in his folly when the luſt is up, when the luſt hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the hill, the advantage: when it is active, ruling, and ſwaying in the man; and this is according to the manner of the Scripture ſpeech, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 43. <hi>When the unclean ſpirit</hi> is in a man: the meaning of that place, as <hi>Cameron</hi> well obſerves, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>The world lies in the wicked one,</hi> that is, in his power: to be under his power, is to be in him; to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41800:147"/> meet a fool in his folly, is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of his folly, when folly hath dominion over the man. But what is it to meet a Bear rob'd of her whelps? wherein lies the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? a Bear is a ſavage creature and a creature of prey; and a ſhe-Bear is the moſt ravenous, but eſpecially a ſhe-Bear rob'd of her whelps: ſo it is here, becauſe it ſtands between the heart and the treaſure; the heart goeth out to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and can indure no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and bear no denial. And as it can bear no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo it can indure no delay and procraſtination: and therefore you ſhall finde <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> covetouſneſs was his predominant luſt; he went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the wages of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: now <hi>Balaams</hi> luſt is too
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41800:147"/> ſwift for <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs: the Aſs cannot make ſo much haſt as his luſt, he can indure no delay; nay do but obſerve, tis an excellent expreſſion, ſpoken of the Babylonians, when the King and his Army came to invade their neighbor Nation, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>They ſhall come as an Eagle doth haſten to eat the prey:</hi> you know of all birds the Eagle flies ſwifteſt, and never ſo ſwift as when ſhe goes to catch the prey: ſo the heart goeth after the treaſure as the Eagle goeth after the prey, it can endure no delay; Thats the third demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this which is the cleareſt demonſtration of it; Let a man change his treaſure, and preſently h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is the firſt and great change, when a man changes his chief good; but when that is done once, the ſoul that went out after it before, now turns from that which was his chief good, and perſecutes that with the greateſt earneſtneſs that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did cleave unto: there be two things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>

There are two expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſomewhat alike, one is <hi>to fulfil after God,</hi> and the other is <hi>to cleave after God, Numb.</hi> 14. 24. <hi>Caleb</hi> had another ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>he followed God fully,</hi> he <hi>fulfilled after God,</hi> ſo tis in the Hebrew: this points out the ſincerity of a mans heart: and to cleave after God, tis ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the conſtancy of a mans purſuit, the heart goes out, the bent of the ſoul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tends that way; yea, he that before followed after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, now cleaves after God:
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41800:149"/> what is the reaſon? the chief good is changed.</p>
                  <p>And as there is converſion; ſo there is averſion. Take a man that now looks on ſin as a cheat, and all the comforts of the creatures to be but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and that he hath taken copper for gold all that while: what then? his heart turns from them with the greateſt averſion that is poſſible: you know thoſe places, I need not repeat them, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols, Hoſ.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>Say to the Idols, get you hence:</hi> therefore the heart is with the treaſure: where the treaſure is, there is the heart; but now change the treaſure, and the purſuit of the heatt is changed. Thus much for the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it: I hope all theſe things may be uſefull to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41800:149"/> every underſtanding hearer.</p>
                  <p>But why is it that the heart always goeth out to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? that where the treaſure is, there the heart is: why, what is the cauſe?</p>
                  <p>There are ſix great grounds of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the treaſure, which I expound the chief good, is <hi>animae pabalum,</hi> the food upon which the ſoul feeds; and if it be ſo, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſoul goeth out after it; the heart cannot live without it; take an unregenerate man, and it is his treaſure his heart feeds upon; he <hi>eats the bread of wickedneſs, and drinks the wine of violence:</hi> take a godly man, and he doth not <hi>labour for the meat that periſheth, but for that which endures to eternal life, Joh.</hi> 6. 27. This is the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41800:150"/> food his ſoul feeds upon; and for this cauſe in the Scripture you have ſo often expreſſions of hungring and thirſting; and you know what violent impreſſions thoſe make upon the ſpirits of men: what is all this but to let you ſee that the chief good is the food of the ſoul, and therefore the heart makes after it, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the chief good is not only the food, but <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae ſuſtentaoulum,</hi> the ſupport of the ſoul, the ſoul of man without it is not able to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 8. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, my heart is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propt: ſo <hi>Montanus</hi> renders the word, <hi>ſuffultum eſt cor meum:</hi> then truly the heart of man muſt be propt, it is not able to ſtand of it ſelf, it
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41800:150"/> muſt have a ſupport: and whence is that ſupport? pray look, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 15. there is <hi>a man that leans upon his houſe:</hi> what is that? his hope, the object of his hope; he cannot ſtand without it ſupport; that which is his comfort in reference to eternity, upon this his ſoul leans; and ſo the godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 26. <hi>My fleſh and my heart fails me, but God is the ſtrength of my heart:</hi> he goes to his chief good, becauſe he cannot ſtand alone: he muſt have ſomewhat to reſt upon; and thats the reaſon that <hi>a rich mans wealth is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>his ſtrong tower:</hi> it is that which defends him: the heart muſt needs go to the treaſure: tis the hearts food, and tis the hearts ſupport: it cannot be ſupported one moment without it.</p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:41800:151"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, it is the ſouls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, the delight of the heart: <hi>oblectamentum animae:</hi> the heart of man cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it long; and all the delight the ſoul hath, comes in from its chief good; the chief good is the object of the higheſt love, and of the greateſt truſt, and tis the object of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt delight; and therefore the ſoul of man muſt go out to its treaſure, becauſe all its joy comes in by it: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delight the ſoul cannot live. Why is Hell ſaid to be death? becauſe there is no joy, no delight; why is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſaid to be life? <hi>becauſe in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at thy right hand are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delight the ſoul cannot live.</p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:41800:151"/>
                  <p> Saith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Take away all delight, and the ſoul dies: let there be but pure dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs once, and the ſoul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is a mans chief good, that is <hi>animae ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the beauty of the ſoul, that wherein the beauty of the ſoul doth lie; and indeed take the ſoul off from this, and it is naked: the heart of man is naked, taken off from his chief good: will you but obſerve, and ſee both put together? <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 33. <hi>Can amaid forget her ornaments, and a bride her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire?</hi> Take a poor creature, all the beauty ſhe hath lies in cloaths; as I ſometime told you, that is like the Cinnamon Tree, that hath nothing good but the Bark; indeed tis true, you dare not go without your
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41800:152"/> ornaments; to be ſure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you forget, you will not forget to make your ſelvs fine, to deck your ſelves: I am afraid divers of you forget moſt other things except that: but can ſhe? why, can ſhe not? there is not a natural impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility indeed, but a moral: that is it wherein ſhe glories, and ſhe cannot forget it; but ſaith God, <hi>I am your ornament, your glory:</hi> you ought to make me your chief good, <hi>and you forget me days without number:</hi> the ſoul goeth out to its trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and cannot forget it: for this is that wherein all its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and beauty lies; and the truth is, all the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſoul comes from a mans treaſure, and chief good.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the heart muſt go
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41800:152"/> out to to the treaſure: for tis <hi>animae ſpiraculum:</hi> this is that in which the ſoul breaths; pray conſider it; <hi>we rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. Deſpair is that which ſtrangles the ſoul; the ſoul lives in hope: what is that hope carried after? why, after its chief good; therefore the ſoul breaths no other breath: <hi>My ſoul pants after God,</hi> gaſps after God, breaths after God, ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 42. 1. In this the ſoul lives, this is the breathing place of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, here only is <hi>animae requies,</hi> the reſt of the ſoul: <hi>Return unto thy reſt, oh my ſoul, Pſal.</hi> 116. 7. Now it is only the chief good that the ſoul reſts in, this is only the object of fruition; the ſoul is reſtleſs
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41800:153"/> until it come to this, but it is ever moving towards it: theſe be the reaſons why the heart of man muſt of neceſſity be where the treaſure is.</p>
                  <p>But now the next thing is, how is the heart of man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after its treaſure? doth it always go after it, that the heart is where the chief good is continually: how is it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after it?</p>
                  <p>Here give me leave to lay down ſix Concluſions, which are of marvellous great uſe, and great truths every one of them. I ſhall but name them, though they need a great deal of explication.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the heart goeth after the treaſure continually; the ſoul of man is always active, never idle: and whats the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all its motions: truly
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41800:153"/> tis well obſerved by the Schools, that <hi>Summum bonnum eſt omnium operationum origo:</hi> The chief good is the reaſon of all the motions of the ſoul, the ſoul moves continually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: now from thence all motions do ariſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 23. he ſpeaks there of a covetous rich man, whoſe chief good is his wealth, there is his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: <hi>his heart takes no reſt at night,</hi> ſaith he: his bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, that is neceſſitated to take reſt, but his heart is reſtleſs, becauſe ſtill it is carried after its trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and therefore day and night is never at reſt, always moving: what is the reaſon? becauſe ſtill it is carried after the treaſure continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The heart goes after the treaſure infinitely
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41800:154"/> unſatiably, that where a mans treaſure and chief good is, there the heart is never ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but it is going out after it without meaſure; thoſe that place it here below, you know the expreſſion, <hi>Habbak.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>they imarge their defires as hell,</hi> and can never be ſatisfied: true the chief good indeed gives meaſure to all ſubordinate things; but it is without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it ſelf; ſo that he that hath a treaſure, his heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely carried after it: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be below or above, he is never ſatisfied; oh the infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e diſ-ſatisfaction in the ſoul, that hath once ſet the Lord, and choſen him for his chief good! he is always growing, gaſping, crying, mourning, walking after God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a mans treaſure
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:41800:154"/> or chief good, the heart takes faſt hold of, and poſſeſſes it for his own: pray obſerve it: there be other things indeed that the heart looks upon as other mens goods; but his chief good he poſſeſſes as his own; tis his own, tis his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: ſo obſerve, <hi>Iob</hi> 8. 15. the place I cited before; he ſhall not only <hi>lean upon his houſe, but hold faſt his houſe:</hi> the Text ſaith, take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow a poor covetous wretch, whoſe money is his treaſure; an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious man, his honor is his treaſure; take a poor proud woman, and vanity in apparel is her treaſure: Let the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God be denounced, and the Miniſters of God ſtrive to take off the men, they hold it faſt and will not let it go, they will contend for it,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41800:155"/> and look upon them as the worſt enemies in the world that labour to pull it from them: pray obſerve it, for in this way the heart goes out to the treaſure, he holds it faſt; and this is the true cauſe why converſion is a work of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power: becauſe as <hi>Proſper</hi> well obſerves, <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum nemo perdit niſi volens:</hi> no man loſes his chief good, but by his will: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that ſhall change a mans chief good, muſt change his will, which all the Angels in Heaven cannot do; till God change his will, he never lets go his chief good, and this is the marriage of the ſoul; that which is a mans treaſure, it is his marriage, tis an Almighty power muſt break that band: men are ſaid to be <hi>married to</hi>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:41800:155"/> 
                     <hi>ſin</hi> upon that account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 5. purely becauſe it is a mans treaſure; thus the heart goeth out to it, the heart holds it faſt: take another man that makes God his Treaſure and ſpiritual things, God in Chriſt; and what then? why come temptation, the man holds his treaſure; come deſertion, the man holds his treaſure: look to <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88. <hi>I am free among the dead, like thoſe that lie in the grave, whom thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt no more:</hi> yet ſaith he, <hi>My God, I cry day and night:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is God is his treaſure; if he loſe that, he is undone; take God from me, and I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, or elſe you can never undo me; the ſoul holds it faſt; <hi>he ſtays upon his God and leans upon his beloved;</hi> this is another way how the heart
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41800:156"/> goeth out to the treaſure, it holds it faſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if at any time the heart be ſhaken, to its trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and chief good it returns again; ſhake it while you will, thither it will return again: take an unregenerate man, and his beloved ſin ſhakes him; many times <hi>his knees ſhake and his bowels tremble within him:</hi> yet after this the man returns to his vomit again, ſtill he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his treaſure; as the unclean ſpirit that goes out of the man, returns: ſo a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his treaſure again: and ſo a godly man let him be by temptations ſhaken off from God, yet notwithſtanding for all that the ſoul returns to God again: that as when you throw a bowl, it may ſeem to run ſtrait for a time; but after
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41800:156"/> the force that was put upon it is ſpent, the biaſs takes it and carries it another way: ſo it is here; whiles the violence of temptation laſts, the ſoul ſeems to be carried away from God: but the biaſs of the ſoul takes it and carries it to the chief good again: ſo that a godly man, though his ſoul be ſhaken from God never ſo much, hath a principle within him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces him again: <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my former Husband, Hoſ.</hi> 2. 17. Somewhat will bring about the ſoul again, as by that ordinary ſimilitude, As the needle toucht with the loadſtane will come about again to its own poſture: ſo its with the ſoul that hath the true touch from heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the change of a mans chief good is a godly
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41800:157"/> mans firſt change, tis his great change, it is his chief change; the great change to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what is that? <hi>they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me</hi> as the chief good; <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>and digged to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves broken Ciſterns:</hi> Now to return to God again, is the firſt and chief change; and thats another reaſon, why conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a work of Almighty power: Who is able to exalt God in the ſoul as the chief good? none but himſelf; the Sctipture ſpeaks frequently of <hi>exalting God, and of the Lords exalting himſelf; exalt thy ſelf in thy own ſtrength; and exalt God in his name jah, and rejoyce before him:</hi> then you exalt the moſt High when you lift up God in yout ſouls as the chief good; then the Lord exalts himſelf when he ſets up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41800:157"/> in the ſoul as a treaſure; and then with the change of a mans chief good there is a change of all the motions in the ſoul; and do not talk of a change of thy motions, and of thy actions: it will never do thee good, unleſs it be founded in this, the change of thy chief good, and thy ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt end.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to cloſe theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſiderations, in the chief good the liberty or bondage of the heart lies; the heart goes after it, and therein lies either liberty or bondage: the liberty of the heart is in the chief good: <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, then are you free indeed,</hi> Joh. 8. 21. Now wherein lies the liberty that the ſoul hath with the Son? <hi>In adhaeſione animae ad Deum:</hi>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:41800:158"/> that it is faſtned on God, as the chief good, cleaving to God as the chief good, and looking on all other things no otherways then as they are in ſubordination to him: there is the liberty: the ſoul cleaves to God, and to God alone, and looks upon all other things barely as in ſubordination to God; and this is the liberty that Chriſt purchaſt, when he is ſaid to <hi>bring you to God:</hi> that is, to bring you to God as the chief good: and the more the ſoul is taken up with this chief good, the freer it is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider in heaven there is perfect liberty: what is the reaſon? becauſe there the ſoul is wholly taken up with God, and taken off from all things elſe: and therefore in hell, <hi>ſervitus conſummatur;</hi> there is
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41800:158"/> perfect bondage: what is the reaſon? becauſe the ſoul there is wholly taken off from God, wholly ſet againſt God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now all men that have their treaſure below, their ſouls are in bondage: and my brethren, the Doctrine of the liberty and bondage of the will, will never be rightly opened, unleſs this bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in it be rightly limited; for it is from the hearts clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to this or that chief good, that the liberty or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of a man doth ariſe: and ſo much for the general open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this great truth. The Treaſure is attractive of the heart.</p>
                  <p>I come now to ſpeak unto it more particularly; for ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe are the great things
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41800:159"/> in which your ſouls ſhould be always imployed; the heart you ſee, and the treaſure is in ſeparable: the heart will be where the treaſure is: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as the treaſure is, ſuch is the heart: as well as where the treaſure is, there is the heart: if the treaſure be laid upon earth, then men are ſaid to be <hi>earthly minded, or to mind earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3. 19. that is, though their ſouls go up and down among many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (for the heart of man doth cheapen here and there, before it buys) yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all is included in the things below: <hi>he minds earthly things,</hi> and only earth: his heart never goes beyond the treaſure: ſo if his treaſure be in heaven, then his minde is there, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. tis true he doth
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41800:159"/> uſe the things below, as his fleſh and his own exigences doth require, but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his heart is not ſhut up in theſe as another mans is: but he goeth out to his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which is above, that as <hi>his converſation is his in heaven,</hi> ſo likewiſe his meditation is there alſo: all thoſe things that are ſeated in his heart, they are all there, as we ſhall hereafter ſhew: hence it comes to paſs, that a godly man is ſaid to be <hi>a ſtranger here; I am a ſtranger here, and a ſojourner as all my fathers were,</hi> Pſa. 39. latter end: why what is the reaſon? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not converſe here as if it were his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: no, he doth ſeek a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, becauſe his treaſure is not here; therefore he is a ſtranger here: tis an excellent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:41800:160"/> that of <hi>Bernard, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma juſti coelum eſt, &amp; in coelo.</hi> A godly mans heart is heaven, becauſe God dwels there, and tis in heaven, becauſe there he dwells with God; and for this cauſe, grace is called glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Scriptures, not only becauſe it is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that grace whereof a man ſhall in glory receive the perfection; nor only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a pledge and earneſt of it, and will certainly end in glory: but becauſe indeed the ſoul immediatly enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory after a ſort: for his treaſure being in heaven, his heart is there alſo: this we are to conſider, that a godly man is by this means in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whiles he is here. Yea, more in heaven then he is in earth before his tranſlation:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41800:160"/> for his treaſure is in heaven, and his heart is there.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee in particular, what is here intended by the heart: more eſpecially there is by the heart in Scripture then meant all thoſe things that are ſeated in the heart. I gave many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it before, Let us begin with the firſt of them.</p>
                  <p>The heart in Scripture is put for the aim, the tendency, the bent of the heart, <hi>animi propoſitus,</hi> the propenſity of the heart: this is called the heart in Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24, 25. The Lord there gives a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction concerning the hireling, that his wages muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained beyond the day of his labour: <hi>At his day thou ſhalt give him his hire: neither ſhall the ſun go down upon it; for he</hi>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:41800:161"/> 
                     <hi>is poor, and ſetteth his heart upon it:</hi> whats that? he is a hireling, and therefore neither love to his maſter, nor love to his work, but the aim and bent of his ſoul in all the labour he takes is the hire he receives for it; <hi>he ſets his heart upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>:</hi> therefore the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>a double heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 33. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 2. Now what makes the heart a double heart? ſome do apply it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability in opinion, that which is called halting between two opinions, when the minde is in a ſuſpence, and hangs like a Meteor: thats the Metaphor that Chriſt uſes, <hi>be ye not of doubtfull minds,</hi> Luke 12. 20. ſo you read it.</p>
                  <p>Whether it be in reference to opinion, or in reference to love, the minde is in doubt:
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:41800:161"/> tis very true, he that is ſo, ſometimes propends this way, and ſometimes that way: this man after a ſort is a double-minded man. But I conceive the intention of Scripture, by a double heart, mainly refers to the aim and intention of the heart: when men are double in their intentions, the bent of their hearts goeth not all one way; but ſometimes for God, and ſometimes for the world: ſometimes for heaven, and ſometimes for earth; when men have not <hi>a ſingle eye,</hi> that is, as I conceive, a ſingle aim; this the Scripture calleth a double heart: when a man hath an aim at God, and the things of God, and looks at nothing elſe, but purely in ſubordination, this is a ſingle heart; this man hath a ſingle
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41800:162"/> aim; but when men go ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very hot after the things of God, and by and by are as eager in purſuit after the things of this life, certainly this is a double heart; ſo <hi>the heart is ſaid to be turned away from God,</hi> 1 Kin. 11. 3, 4. what is that? the bent and aim of the heart was from God; I will add no more but that <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 21. <hi>Peter ſaid to Simon Magus, thy heart is not right:</hi> he had been baptized and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the gift of the Holy Ghoſt: but he did not this with a pure intention, not with a right aim; God ſaw the crooked aims and purpoſes of his heart in all the ſervice, and ſo <hi>the word</hi> is ſaid <hi>to diſcover the intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. then in the Scriptures, by heart is meant the aims, the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:41800:162"/> purpoſes, the bent, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the heart: where a mans treaſure is, there is his bent and aim: and this I ſhall now pitch upon; it is a thing that above all others you had need be careful of: for the great thing you are to look to is your heart: <hi>keep thy heart above all things,</hi> and in the heart lieth the great deceit; <hi>the heart is deceitfull above all things, and deſperatly wicked:</hi> therefore eſpecially look to your hearts; but in the heart above all other, the bent of the heart, what is its aim and tendency, and that upon a double ground, which I muſt premiſe, before I come to particulars.</p>

                  <p>The firſt Rule is this:</p>
                  <p>What the ſoul is carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under different conditions: this declares what the aim of the ſoul is, what it tends unto, by that you may judge of the tendency of the heart; as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, though you may turn

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:41800:168"/> and maſter luſt; bring this man into proſperity, why then it vents it ſelf in ſelf-exaltation, admiration, Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of glory from men, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf in the face and glory of the times, in deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of others, and preferring himſelf. Bring this man at any time under trouble of conſcience: why then pride vents it ſelf in his humility and ſelf-abaſement: bring him into poverty, and then pride ſhews it ſelf in its baſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and deſpair; for as faith is the moſt humbling grace, ſo of all others diſpair is the higheſt fruit of pride, vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf in murmuring and diſcontent; here is a heart ſhewing the ſame aim in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conditions: all this clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argues where the bent of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:41800:168"/> the heart is; and ſo alſo let the aim of a mans heart go out to coveteouſneſs, the love of mony, when he is in a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, truly if he obſerve his ſoul, it bends out with earneſt deſires that way, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all thoſe that are well ſtored with it; as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer calls the proud happy, ſo this accounts the rich a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man. But now let him be brought into a wealthy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now he hath more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and by theſe the luſt hath more vent; there is ſtill the ſame bent of ſoul; this ſtill argues what the aim of a mans heart is, when it is the ſame in different condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, put a man into what condition you will, the heart ſtill goes the ſame way; as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs was that which

Thus take a man in what condition you will, and you finde the aim of his heart is the ſame: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, take another man that is godly, who hath another treaſure, and by this means his ſoul hath another aim; put him into what condition you will, ſtill the bent of his heart is the ſame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 19. <hi>Though thou haſt ſmitten us into the place of Dragons, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us with the ſhadow of death, yet we have not gone</hi>

Its very true in different conditions, men have not the ſame vent for their luſts, but ſtill the bent of the heart is the ſame; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what thou waſt when thou wert young, and what now: what in adverſity, and what in proſperity; conſider what thou wert when a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man; and what now thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On the contrary, take a godly man, look where the aim of his heart lieth, though there be no occaſion given, yet you will quickly ſee his

                  <p>Fifthly, where the bent and aim of the heart is, there it is continually reſtleſs until it obtain that which it tendeth unto: the aim of the heart, it is <hi>pondus animae,</hi> the weight of

                  <p>Laſtly, that which is the aim of a mans heart, that he makes uſe of all things elſe to obtain: makes all things elſe in the world ſerviceable and ſubordinate thereunto: if the bent of the heart be ſet on

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41800:179"/> men do it, then they ſhall be courted from all parts: <hi>Iehu</hi> when he meets <hi>Ionadab</hi> the ſon of <hi>Rechab,</hi> a man ſo famous and honorable among the Jews for holineſs and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Religion: <hi>Iehu</hi> falls on him eſpecially, <hi>Is thy heart right with my heart?</hi> there is a double interpretation that Expoſitors give of the words. <hi>Cajetan</hi> and others. <hi>Ita me ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere amas?</hi> or, <hi>Ita ne mea facta probas?</hi> doſt thou love me truly, as I love thee? for no man profeſſed ſincerity more then he whoſe whole trade was a way of hypocriſie. But <hi>Peter Martir</hi> and ſome others: he had deſtroyed the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and was going now to deſtroy the houſe of <hi>Baal:</hi> if thy heart fall in with my in tereſt, approve what I have

                  <p>The ſecond particular for the opening of the Doctrine. The heart in Scripture, is put for the wiſdom, the ſtudies, the plots, the contrivances of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:41800:180"/> the heart; and if it be ſo, then where the treaſure is, there is the wiſdom, and there are the deſigns of the heart: Let us take ſome inſtances of this, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>Ye fools, underſtand wiſdom, underſtand the heart:</hi> ſo it is according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 32. <hi>He that heareth reproof getteth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; he gets a heart:</hi> and ſo alſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Fools die for want of wiſdom;</hi> it is for want of a heart; and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 11. <hi>Ephraim is a filly Dove without a heart,</hi> that is, without wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: ſo then the wiſdom of the heart, the plots, counſels and deſigns of the heart, theſe are called the heart in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. ſaith, <hi>At the laſt day he will make manifeſt the Counſels of the heart:</hi> there be the deep
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:41800:181"/> plots and deſigns; there is the wiſdom of the man; then this is put for the heart: and where a mans treaſure is, there are his deſigns, there is his wiſdom; and for this cauſe, <hi>there is wiſdom that is earthly, and there is wiſdom ihat is from above, Jam.</hi> 3. 15, 17. If a mans treaſure be on the earth, all the wiſdom he hath goes no higher, all his plots and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns never riſe above the earth; if his treaſure be in heaven, his wiſdom is heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Do but obſerve that which is a very choice Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 8. <hi>The children of this world are wiſer in their generation, then the children of light:</hi> the children of this world; he doth intimate now of two ſorts of men, and two ſorts of wiſdom; both of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:41800:181"/> them are wlſe in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the one his wiſdom reaches not beyond this world; the other his wiſdom is in reference to the world to come; or as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. and ſo ſome do expound that expreſſion, wiſer in their generation. <hi>Grotius</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſaith, that the Hebrews do uſe to put generation for action: <hi>actiones denotat,</hi> actions are called generations: and <hi>Chemuiſius</hi> goes likewiſe the ſame way, they are wiſer in their generation: <hi>In rebus ſuis agendis,</hi> in doing their own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and accompliſhing their own ends: here they are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer: in theſe things below, a godly man is ſaid to be a babe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 22. but the children of light are wiſer in
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:41800:182"/> their generation too then the children of the world: now every mans wiſdom in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his treaſure is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in three things:</p>
                  <p>In getting of it.</p>
                  <p>In keeping of it.</p>
                  <p>In improving and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it.</p>
                  <p>And all the wiſdom, plots, and deſigns of men are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in theſe three things, all about their treaſure.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, every mans wiſdom is exerciſed about his treaſure in the getting of it: if it be pleaſure, then obſerve the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Amnon,</hi> by the advice of his friend <hi>Jonadab,</hi> for the obtaining of his luſt upon his ſiſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. And certainly in this reſpect, even the counſels of the fleſh are deep, and mightily aſſiſted
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:41800:182"/> from below: and ſo if a man hath a deſire to riſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence and to be ſuperior is the thing aimed at, and the treaſure be laid up in it, ſee with what wiſdom he can do it: take the inſtance of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> his aim was to be head of the ten Tribes: obſerve his policy, and tis remarkable, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12. It lets a man ſee that there is all knowledge in the Scripture: firſt, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> muſt come in and diſcontent the people, by telling them of their former preſſures, and hard uſages: this being done, he muſt take advantage of the ſame diſcontent of the people growing high in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: hereupon who ſo like to be the head of the people upon choice, as he that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured and hazarded ſo much
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41800:183"/> for them, and ſeems to be ſo far tender of their preſſures, and to finiſh all, there muſt come in the old propheſie of <hi>Abijah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>that God will rend ten tribes from the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and give them to Jeroboam.</hi> Do but obſerve, it is plain, as a mans treaſure is, ſo his wiſdom works in the getting of it; but there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance in Scripture that is a mighty one; which I ſhall not give the whole ſtory of, but ſpeak ſomewhat: it is that of Antichriſt, <hi>The woman that rides upon the ſcarlet coloured beaſt, and ſits upon many waters,</hi> that is, rules over many people: why? do but obſerve, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion being the thing aimed at, the ſtrange ways that have bin taken; look to the riſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. and you ſee
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:41800:183"/> he ariſes in the double ſhape ſuitable to the twofold power he aims at: firſt, <hi>the beaſt that riſes out rf the Sea: ſo he hath ſeven heads and ten horns:</hi> he comes in upon the breach of the Roman Empire, when the Goths and Vandals had given it <hi>its deadly wound;</hi> and he joyns with the ten Kings to ſet up an Image of the former Roman Empire, and to put life into it: an Image it was and but an Image; they were all zealous for the Roman Empire; and this Antichriſt got exceedingly by; he and the ten Kings that ſubmitted to him, now made up one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Empire; but this was not power enough, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ariſes under the ſhape of another beaſt, not out of the Sea, but out of the earth,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:41800:184"/> 
                     <hi>ſtirpium more,</hi> after the manner of herbs that inſenſibly grow: and this is his Eccleſiaſtical power over the conſciences of men; for all pretence of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power was to gain this compleat power of ruling over the conſciences of men; and thus you ſee, whatever a man makes his treaſure, all his wiſdom runs out unto: this you ſhall finde in reference to Religion alſo, a godly man, all the wiſdom he hath tends that way; for I told you, <hi>It was to make him wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> there is all his wiſdom; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>If by any means I may attain to the reſurrection of the dead;</hi> he means the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the juſt: all the wiſdom that he aimed at was upon this account: ſo that a godly man
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:41800:184"/> hath but one deſign in the world, and that is that he may enjoy God and Chriſt, where his treaſure is, that he may get an intereſt in God by Chriſt, tis all the deſign he hath: and therefore <hi>Bernard</hi> doth very well obſerve, <hi>Mens ſapientis ſemper eſt apud Deum:</hi> A wiſe mans heart is always with God, that is, all his plots and contrivance is, how he may bring about that great buſineſs: all his wiſdom is ſaid out upon this, how he may get his treaſure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when he hath once got it, his great deſign and wiſdom is exerciſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, how he may keep it: thus it is with men, whoſe treaſure is on the earth: they know that <hi>ruſt and moth will corrupt, and thieves break through and</hi>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:41800:185"/> 
                     <hi>ſteal:</hi> and therefore they all contrive to keep what they have gotten: for they do know that there be F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nners: ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will ſend fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners upon Babylon,</hi> Jer. 51. Take away all the chaff that now hangs about, that you may well ſpare, and yet indevour to keep ſo cloſe: now on this account men are marvellous ſollicitous: what care is there for conveyances and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances? and all is purely upon this, becauſe men uſe their wiſdom to keep their treaſure: thou whoſoever thou be that endeavoureſt to make ſafe here below, pray mark that place, and conſider all you whoſe treaſure is on earth, <hi>Job</hi> 20. 15. <hi>He ſwallows down riches, but he ſhall vomit them up:</hi> God will pull it out of his
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:41800:185"/> belly; and therefore in the midſt of their ſufficiency they are in ſtraits, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Upon this account it is that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the world is mightily exerciſed about that, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how to get, but how to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their treaſure: tis true of a godly man too: God in Chriſt is his chief good, his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; how he may ſecure it, that is his plot; he knows that <hi>tis only ſin that ſeparates between him and God:</hi> for this cauſe his deſign is not to ſin: as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> doth obſerve: <hi>nobis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca eſt neceſsitas non deliquendi:</hi> men may pretend neceſſity whiles they will, we have but one neceſſity: a godly man hath but one neceſſity, that he doth not ſin; why? becauſe his ſin robs him of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: nay a godly man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:41800:186"/> though men may loſe their treaſure here unwillingly, yet not withſtanding a treaſure in heaven, <hi>nemo perdit niſi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> no man loſes it but with his own will: why therefore, now his great fear is, leſt his ſoul and his heart ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God; and therefore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 11. <hi>Unite my heart to thee, that I may fear thee;</hi> that I may with full purpoſe of heart cleave unto the Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 28. this his wiſdom is in his treaſure, not only in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but in keeping it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his heart is where his treaſure is, that is, how to improve it, and increaſe it: a treaſure is ſuch a thing as grows by a continual additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: a treaſure is not filled up at once, but by degrees, by a conſtant addition thereunto:
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:41800:186"/> therefore now this is the great ſtudy of the man, all his plots and deſigns are there: as now take a man whoſe treaſure is on earth; you may ſee the man, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 5. one that did deſire Dominion, it is ſpoken of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, he is a proud man,</hi> ſaith the Spirit of God: what is that? he looks on himſelf, as <hi>ad dominium natus, alii ad mancipium,</hi> as a man born to rule, and looks on all other men as born to be ſervants: well, but what doth this put him upon? to increaſe his treaſure: how doth he do it? why <hi>he keeps not at home:</hi> what is that? that is, he is not content with his own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: keeps not within his own territories and dominions, but <hi>gath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So like wiſe conſider a godly man whoſe treaſure is above in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in enjoying God and Chriſt: well truly, what eſteem ſoever he hath in the world, it doth not much trouble him; thats a great
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:41800:187"/> ſpeech of one of the ancients, <hi>Magis ardere quam lucere nititur ſapiens:</hi> A wiſe man loveth heat rather then light, chooſes rather to have it within in his own ſoul then to appear among others; now becauſe the way to injoy much of God is to be much in communion with him: therefore always his ſoul deſires communion: <hi>the Spirit ſaith come, and the Bride ſaith come:</hi> if there be degrees of enjoyment, he would have the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, it is his treaſure, and he is adding to it, and his wiſdom lies in that: <hi>Habet &amp; ſapientia ſui generis ſuperbiam:</hi> there is a holy pride, as the Father ſaith: now how is this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? <hi>he rewards every man according to his works:</hi> and what ſhall that reward be? <hi>I</hi>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:41800:188"/> 
                     <hi>am your reward;</hi> not only that I may have fuller communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him here, but fuller fruition of him hereafter: this is his deſign: yea this is his wiſdom, his wiſdom is always exerciſed about his treaſure, in getting, or keeping, or in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and increaſing it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the heart in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is uſed for the <hi>thoughts,</hi> not only for the conſultations and counſels of the heart, but for the meditations of it; and ſo our Saviours meaning is: <hi>where your treaſure is, there will the thoughts of your hearts be:</hi> for this cauſe God is ſaid <hi>to ſearch the heart,</hi> and <hi>to know the heart, Cogitationes intimas &amp; abſconditas,</hi> that is, all the moſt ſecret thoughts of the heart; thoſe ſecret thoughts which are hid from all elſe
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:41800:188"/> in the world God only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and therfore is ſaid to ſearch the heart, and know the heart, that is, to know the thoughts: and <hi>David</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 23. <hi>Search me and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts:</hi> thus he explains it: and <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 15, 17. <hi>Dalilah</hi> ſaith to <hi>Sampſon: How canſt thou ſay thou loveſt me, when thou hideſt thy heart from me? and he told her all his heart,</hi> that is, <hi>all his thoughts.</hi> Now then the thoughts in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they are put for the heart, and indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing carries the heart more with it, then the thoughts doth, and nothing wherein there is leſs deceit, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the heart, then in thoughts: the thoughts are the firſt-born of the ſoul, the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:41800:189"/> hearts immediate iſſues: now if a man would taſte water, the way not to be deceived, is to taſt it in the Spring; if a man would taſte wine, the way not to be deceived, is to taſte it in the wine-preſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is adulterated by the Vintner: ſo our actions and words many times are adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated: therefore the heart mightily goes where the thoughts go; you cannot ſay mens hearts go with their words; no, very ſeldom, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this diſſembling age; men ſeldom ſpeak as they mean; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of a man that invites one to dinner, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 6, 7. <hi>Eat and drink, but his heart is not with thee:</hi> he bids thee eat, but his heart is not with his words: but I ſay, there is the leaſt ſuſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:41800:189"/> of deceit in thoughts; that if a man can but know which way his thoughts go, that way certainly his heart goes.</p>
                  <p>Now I have but four Rules to offer in reference to your thoughts; but pray obſerve them; for I do but touch on theſe things on purpoſe, that you may a little know how you may eſpie out your own hearts: the thoughts youl ſay, run upon ten thouſand things, how is any man ever able to know where his thoughts are? a mans thoughts are every where. There are four Rules I ſhall give, whereby you may know where your thoughts, and by that where your hearts are.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when you are alone, ſequeſtred from company, out
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:41800:190"/> of the noiſe of your callings, and outward imployments: whither then do your thoughts uſually retire? where commonly are your thoughts then? for the truth is, the man is as he is when he is alone; ſuch as the thoughts of the heart are, ſuch is the man: as for example, <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar;</hi> the queſtion is not where his thoughts were when he was abroad in war: he was at peace, and walking in his palace at home: now where are his thoughts? <hi>is not this great Babel, that I have built for the honour of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty?</hi> and how he had been the head of gold; the firſt that raiſed that glorious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; here were his thoughts: take a godly man, and where are his thoughts, when he is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:41800:190"/> in his Cloſet, or upon his bed, or when he awakes in the night? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 18. ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, when I awake, I am ſtill with thee:</hi> therefore when you are alone, look where your thoughts uſually go: for the man is as he is when he is alone.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Would you know where your thoughts are? why, then what are the thoughts that you uſe to finde the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſweetneſs in? a man may think of a great many things that he finds no content in: but what are the thoughts wherein you uſe to finde the greateſt ſweetneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? ſure there is your heart: <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 139. 17. <hi>How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious are thy thoughts unto me oh God:</hi> another man the thoughts of his luſts are ſweet, and he
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:41800:191"/> acts over his wickedneſs in a contemplative way; but the thoughts of God are bitter to him, his thoughts trouble him, as it was with <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> when he ſaw the handwriting on the wall, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>His thoughts troubled him.</hi> But <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> becauſe God was his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, his thoughts were ſweet and precious to him; now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what thoughts come in upon you with greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, what thoughts are of longeſt continuance, that your ſouls do moſt abide upon? the thoughts that abide upon your hearts, moſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver where they are. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>How long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> take a man whoſe heart is ſet upon things below, and not only thoughts
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:41800:191"/> come in to him (for ſo they do to Godly men) but they dwell and abide there: but as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> his thoughts never ſtay on God, nor the things of eternity. Pray conſider it, where do your thoughts ſtay moſt? take now a natural man, and caſt in but a thought of his treaſure, it abides upon him: he rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates upon it afterwards, and he ſucks great ſweetneſs from it: but caſt in a thought of heaven, or God, and he is like the dead ſea, his heart is like the dead ſea, of which it is ſaid, whatever living thing is caſt into it dies immediately; ſo caſt in any ſuch thought, and it dies preſently, and will not abide.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, what are thoſe
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41800:192"/> thoughts that commonly take up your hearts in holy duties? tis a very great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there a mans heart is where his thoughts in holy duties moſt commonly are: what is that therefore that takes off your hearts, and takes up your hearts in holy duties? you know that place, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 33. 31. they came there to hear a Sermon, but <hi>their thoughts went after their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs.</hi> Now tis a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument their thoughts were ſet upon their covetouſneſs, becauſe in the duties of Gods worſhip, theſe are the thoughts that moſt take up their hearts; now the ground of this rule is this, Satans great aim in all the duties of Gods worſhip is to take off your thoughts from the duty;
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:41800:192"/> for grace acts by thoughts: therefore when the word is preacht he will catch away the ſeed, if he can; if not, he will keep off the thoughts; and how doth the Devil do that? his way is this, he doth endeavor to prepoſſeſs us, fixes the thoughts of a mans heart on ſomewhat elſe; and what is that? that which is moſt likely to take with a man: truly the thoughts of that he indevors to ſtir up in the ſoul, and what is that? the thoughts of a mans treaſure, thats the thought upon which the heart reſts moſt; and the thoughts to which he is moſt accuſtomed; it is a very great Argument on this ground that thoſe thoughts which moſt commnoly poſſeſs the ſoul in holy duties, that there a mans
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:41800:193"/> heart is, and there his treaſure is; and ſo much the rather, becauſe into the duties of Gods worſhip many other thoughts dare not venture, the ſoul keeps them out; but it is in this reſpect as with a Prince, though at ſometime the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may not approach his preſence, yet a wife, a Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite may; juſt ſo it is with the thoughts of a mans heart: it is I know one great complaint in all the people of God: the wandrings of their ſouls in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: <hi>Bernard</hi> complains of it, <hi>Aliud canto, aliud cogito,</hi> I ſing one thing, when I think ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo I pray one thing when I think another; and hear one thing when my thoughts are upon ſomething elſe. But do you obſerve in all theſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings of ſoul, what is there
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:41800:193"/> to which in duty moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly your ſouls retire: a great argument that that is a mans chief good: examine by theſe Rules, and you ſhall finde out where your thoughts, and by that where your hearts are; thats the third particular.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the heart is put in Scripture for the love of the heart, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>My heart is towards the Governors of Iſrael that offered themſelves willingly among the people:</hi> It is <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> ſpeech in her ſong, after that great victory God had given over <hi>Siſera:</hi> the people of God they love all thoſe that are imployed for God; but in an eſpecial manner the more eminent men are that are imployed, the more their love is drawn out; ſo that by heart is meant her love; ſhe
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:41800:194"/> deſires all may be thankfull, eſpecially the Governors of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had the greateſt ſhare in the mercy, and were the greateſt inſtruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 7. <hi>Eat not the bread of him that hath an evil eye; for though he bid thee eat, yet his heart is not with thee;</hi> his heart is not with thee, what is that? he courts thee, but he loves thee not, and the more he complements with thee, the leſs he affects thee; thus, <hi>thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart:</hi> love carries the heart with it: ſo that the heart of man is truly ſaid to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where it loves then where it lives; thus in Scripture the heart is put for the love: ſo then the meaning is this, where a mans treaſure is, there his love will be.</p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:41800:194"/>
                  <p> But how ſhould a man know where his love is? It is a thing of marvellous great conſequence, for a man to conſider where he ſets and fixes his love: And there are four grounds, why it is a thing of ſo great moment.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe a mans love is his greateſt gift; there is nothing elſe is a gift indeed without love, but <hi>amor per ſe donum,</hi> love is a gift of it ſelf, though there be nothing elſe; <hi>Conſider the love of God, though the Lord had never given you any thing, but ſet his love upon you, it had been the greateſt gift, more then if he had given you all the creatures in heaven and earth: and if God had given you an inheritance among all the creatures, yet there is no gift in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without love; ſo likewiſe</hi>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:41800:195"/> 
                     <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, if he had never given you an intereſt in his Sonſhip, in his victories, in the promiſes, in his priviledges: if he had given you but his love, there is the great gift; all theſe are ſo far gifts, as they flow from love; ſo it is true in you,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 3. <hi>If I give all my goods to feed the poor, and have not charity,</hi> that is, Love, <hi>it profiteth me not. Then a man may give great gifts without love; ſo hypocrites do many times give God great gifts, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their love; ſo God deals with them, gives many of of them great gifts, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his love for his Saints: therefore it is love only is the greateſt gift that a man hath; there is no man giveth more then his love: God gives no more, man can give no more: a great</hi>
                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:41800:195"/> 
                     <hi>matter therefore where a man ſets his love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to inquire where a mans love is, becauſe he that gives his love, gives himſelf, gives all things elſe whatſoever he hath: this is liberal, free love indeed, to give all things to the perſon beloved: yea, he gives himſelf, and all things elſe: I remember tis <hi>Clopen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgs</hi> obſervation, <hi>Satis libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis amor, omnia amato dans, &amp; ſeipſum:</hi> ſo the Lord ſet his love upon his people from eternity, and then purpoſed to give himſelf; yea, therein lay his love: firſt, himſelf, and then all things elſe; ſo the people of God they love the Lord; and therefore they give themſelves unto the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. 1. Love gives it ſelf,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:41800:196"/> and then all things elſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in its power: ſo you finde, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>He ſhall inherit all things, I will be his God;</hi> he ſhall have an intereſt in God, and then all things that God hath ſhall be his; thus as it is with God, ſo likewiſe it is with men, <hi>Qui amorem dat, omnia dat,</hi> he that giveth his love giveth all; for a mans love commands all that he hath; therefore a man inherits all that is Gods; why becauſe God ſets his love upon his people; a mighty thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conſider where a man ſets his love.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a mans love is that which makes the thing belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his; its an excellent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a learned man; <hi>Qui nos ſuper omnes amat, ſuper omnes noſter eſt, Deus:</hi> God is
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:41800:196"/> ours above all, becauſe he loves us more then all: we call our eſtates ours, and our friends ours: Why? God is ours above all things: faith and love give us an intereſt in God; ſo when do we become God's, that the Lord ſaith they be mine, and <hi>they ſhall be mine when I make up my jewels?</hi> why truly by the love of God we become his; he loves us, and by this means he hath a title to us, as we love God, and have a title to him. It is our love that makes <hi>our beloved ours;</hi> of how great conſequence muſt it be then, where a man ſets his love? for thou canſt call nothing thine but what thou loveſt; for it is a mans love that makes it his.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, conſider it is a mans
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41800:197"/> love that ſets the price upon all things, as one obſerves, <hi>Amor imponit pretium rebus:</hi> Love ſets the price on things; and truly great things are of ſmall value where love is wanting: tis ſo with God, tis ſo with men; if the Lord give an ungodly man the greateſt gifts in the world; as <hi>He</hi> ſometimes <hi>gives Kingdoms to the baſeſt of men:</hi> how do the Saints value this? this is without love, and therefore it is but as a ſcrap caſt to a Dog; he values it no more, as he ſaid of the Turkiſh Empire, <hi>Cruſtulam canibus projectam:</hi> ſo likewiſe, let a godly man give to God but a ſmall thing, there is love in it, and love raiſes the price, <hi>That poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the widow that caſt in two mites, gave more then they all,</hi>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:41800:197"/> Luke 21. 12. how did ſhe give more then they all? why they gave of their abundance: It was more in love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore more in worth and acceptation. Now if ſuch things as theſe be true, and you will finde them great truths; how doth it concern every man therefore to conſider where he ſets his love! But what ſhould a man ſet his love upon, that by this means he may know where his heart is? <hi>Omne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt amabile, etiam natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale:</hi> Why truly, all good is lovely wherever it is, and to be beloved, even natural good. We have the example of the Lord for it; we have the example of God for it: God loves all his creatures, and of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:41800:198"/> himſelf, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 21. <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the young man and loved him;</hi> then all good is lovely: but the queſtion is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may not love any thing that is good; but <hi>quid primum amatur:</hi> but as the Schoolmen put a great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, all truth is to be known: but what is that as the firſt truth that the underſtanding cloſes withal? ſo what is firſt to be beloved, is the great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; for where the love is firſt ſet, there is the love, and there is the heart. Conſider I pray what is the meaning of al thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 37. <hi>He that loves father and mother more then me:</hi> to love father and mother is a duty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not here reproved. But what is the firſt thing to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? what hath the chief
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:41800:198"/> place in your love? ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 35. <hi>He that loves his life ſhall loſe it;</hi> every man is bound to love his life, and out of that love to preſerve it; but he that loves his life more then me, more then my truth, and my honor, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Love not the world, and the things of the world:</hi> it is lawfull to love the world, and the things of the world; but ſtill the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, more then me: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſtill that God have the priority; to love the creature more then God, it is that which makes it luſt, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of it; but to love the creature in ſubordination to God, that is Charity; <hi>Hic amor eſt charitas, ille cupiditas:</hi> true love, love of the right kinde; therefore all the things that I ſhall propoſe in this particular,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:41800:199"/> I deſire to be underſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Rule, What is it that you love moſt? not whether you love this more then that; but whether you love theſe more then me; and what is your firſt love?</p>
                  <p>According to this we ſhall inquire, where a mans love is, that by this means, we may know where his heart is: and I am perſwaded, if you take theſe following Rules, and obſerve them carefully, that you will not miſcarry in your Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Would a man know where his love is? what is that he eſpecially deſires uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with? For, <hi>amor eſt affectus unionis:</hi> love is an affection that carries a tendency to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now this will appear, if
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:41800:199"/> you obſerve the love of God, the pattern: union with God was firſt in Gods intention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is laſt in his executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the people of God in glory are brought into imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate viſion of him, and into the cloſeſt union with him. But this being laſt in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſay this was firſt in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: <hi>He loved them with an everlaſting love,</hi> that is, he had intention from <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ernity</hi> of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them. Pray, obſerve it, there is indeed a double union with God.</p>
                  <p>1. Of Dependence: one is general of all the creatures, and thats a Union of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being:</hi> Yea all the creatures have ſo; they cannot live ſeparate from God one moment. The Angels in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:41800:200"/> heaven, did not this union continue, they would fall to nothing immediatly; there is a union of dependency; but that is general, and belongs to all the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>But there is a ſpecial Union that is peculiar to the Saints, by the indwelling of God in them; they dwell in God, and God in them; ſuch a union as no creature in the world but a Saint hath, by the elapſes of God into the ſoul. Now God loves the Saints, and his love carries a tendency to union. So <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> loved his people: what for? that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with them: <hi>That he that ſanctifies, and they that are ſanctified might become one:</hi> why ſo you will finde that the love of the people of God carries them unto union with
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:41800:200"/> God and Chriſt: as the love of God and Chriſt carries them to union with the Saints: there is indeed a natural union that is by conſtitution; but there is a moral union by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by ſympathy, and thats double: there is a union of likeneſs, and there is a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fruition and enjoyment: for the union that the Saints of God ſhall have h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reafter, is far different from what they have here: here it is of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, there it is of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: where a mans love is, there is a tendency to union, an inclination to union, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord,</hi> is one ſpirit, and <hi>the man that is glewed to the Lord:</hi> ſo the word doth ſignifie: then the man that loveth God is a man glewed to God, he is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:41800:201"/> to him; for union is the tendency of the heart: ſo <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> loved <hi>Iacobs</hi> daughter <hi>Dinah:</hi> and the text ſaith, <hi>His ſoul clave to her:</hi> or as the Septuagint uſes the ſame word, his ſoul was glewed; ſo that where a man loveth, the ſoul goeth out to be united to that which is beloved. Now if a man love God, then <hi>my heart follows hard after God:</hi> the ſoul goeth out in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the thing beloved, and all is that it may be made one with God; and to this end you have two Metaphors very remarkable in the Scripture: one is that of a hunter. <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>Nimrod was a mighty hunter. Ier.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>I will bring hunters among you,</hi> Prov. 23. 27. <hi>The wicked roſteth not that which he taketh in hunting.</hi> What is
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:41800:201"/> the meaning of theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? why they are all to ſet forth the purſuit of the ſoul, after that which it loveth; juſt as the hunter purſues the poor creature that flies: ſo the ſoul, what it loves it purſues, and is in continual purſuit of: take men that love riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, their ſouls are continu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally going out to union with them: ſo a man that loves God, his ſoul is in purſuit of God; as that Hermite in a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that ſometime I have read finding a great Gallant hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a deſolate wilderneſs Askt him what he did there; he told him, He came a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there: <hi>Et ego Deum venor meum.</hi> And I ſaid he, came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hunt after my God, tis in purſuit of my God. There is another Metaphor, and that
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:41800:202"/> is a merchandize, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>the merchandize of wiſdom:</hi> its ſpoken of trading for Chriſt, and grace, and the things of eternity; he that Trades for Chriſt, is called <hi>a Merchant man, Matth.</hi> 13. 45. and ſo alſo they that trade for any earthly thing are ſaid to be Merchants. <hi>Romes merchan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diſe</hi> you read of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 11. <hi>Make merchandiſe of ſouls,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. and of <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 12 7. <hi>He is a merchant?</hi> what is that? why the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, they wholly trade for things below: for as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant men go forth to make themſelves poſſeſſors of riches, make it their buſineſs ſo to do: ſo it is with the ſoul of a man; the heart is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, it goeth out to what it loves, and never leavs till it
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:41800:202"/> hath poſſeſt it: now I pray do you conſider, what is it your ſouls deſire moſt? what do you hunt for? what do you trade in? there is thy love, whoever thou art: if it be Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and Communion with God and the things of eternal life: if thou art in the purſuit of theſe conſtantly, there is thy heart: if it he after wealth and honour, theſe thou hunteſt for as prey: aſſuredly there is thy love, and thy heart, and thy treaſure: thats the firſt Rule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, would a man know where his love is? the nearer love comes to the thing beloved, the ſwifter it moves; the nearer a mans love comes to poſſeſs the thing he loves, the ſwifter it moves: yea, it ſtretches after it then: ſee it
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:41800:203"/> in worldly things; or elſe what means that expreſſion? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 10. <hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them:</hi> if you want riches, ſet not your hearts upon them; take heed of that; for the nearer a man comes to enjoy them, the more his heart goeth out unto them; and therefore cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men the richer they are, the more miſerably they ſcrape and gape after riches; and the reaſon is this, becauſe the nearer a mans love comes to the thing beloved, the ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it moves after it, and with the greater earneſtneſs, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 6. There is a man that <hi>loads himſelf with thick clay:</hi> the man hath already too much for his graces, for his parts, for his comforts, and already too much for his accompt; but
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:41800:203"/> yet notwithſtanding the more he hath, the more his heart graſps after it; ſtill thus it is with every mans love, the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer it comes to poſſeſs its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the ſwifter it moves after it: ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſpirituals, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13, 14. <hi>Not that I have already obtained, but I preſs hard to the mark:</hi> I am in a vehement purſuit; as if you could take a ſtone from the earth, and place it in the Orb of the Sun; yet the ſtone having a tendency down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtill, moves towards its center; and the nearer it comes to the center, the ſwifter would its motion be; ſo if you could take an ungodly man, and place him in heaven, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his heart would move towards the earth; his love is there, and the nearer
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:41800:204"/> it comes to enjoy it, the more earneſt would his motion be towards it. I remember on this account it is, that <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, God puts his people here into the condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed perſons: here are but the Eſpouſals, the Marriage is to come; what is the reaſon that there muſt be time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the betrothing and the marriage? that deſires may be kindled ſo much the more: the nearer a man comes to the enjoyment of a thing that he loves, ſure the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently his heart is carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; as for this cauſe you have <hi>the firſt fruits of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> that the more you taſte, the more you may be carried after the full crop of them: as the Lord carried the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſee the Land of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:41800:204"/> 
                     <hi>Canaan</hi> before they enjoyed it; as the <hi>Goths</hi> having once taſted the ſweet wines of <hi>Italy,</hi> would never be quiet until they enjoyed the Countrey where thoſe ſweet wines grew. Examine thy ſelf by this; the nearer thou comeſt to enjoy that thou loveſt, the ſwifter and the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thy heart moves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; if the more thou haſt of this world, with the more violence thou runneſt upon it, as ſome men do that think they ſhall never have enough, graſp after it with great earneſtneſs: ſo on the contrary, the more thou haſt got of intereſt in Chriſt, the more communion thou haſt with him, the more thy heart acts to him with the greater earneſtneſs and impatiency; a
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:41800:205"/> great Argument, there is thy love.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, love is bountifull; where thy bounty is, there is thy love, that is certain; where a man beſtows moſt bounty, there he ſhews moſt love; it is the opening of the heart that opens the hand; and therefore acts of the greateſt bounty are demonſtrations of the higheſt love: you read of <hi>a woman that had much forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her, and ſhe loved much:</hi> the ſame woman <hi>came with a box of ſpikenard very coſtly, Joh.</hi> 12. ſhe loved much, and therefore thought nothing too much for the thing beloved. Gods love is ſo, he loves his people, and therefore becauſe he can give no greater, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows himſelf; he loves his people, and therefore he gives
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:41800:205"/> his ſon: thus <hi>Sichem</hi> loved <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah;</hi> and therefore ſaid, <hi>Ask me never ſo much dowry:</hi> love is bountifull: <hi>Sampſon</hi> loved <hi>Dalilah,</hi> and though he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured his life in it, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he told her all his heart. Conſider I beſeech you, this is another tryal; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 3. ſtirs them up to <hi>a liberal contribution to the poor, what is it for to prove the ſincerity of your love?</hi> men it may be will think the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſpeaks many times for particular intereſts and private reſpects: alas tis to prove the ſincerity of your love, which is ſeen in bounty: now tell me where your bounty is laid out: why truly my bounty is on my apparel, and I think there I can never be too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, becauſe I think this poor
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:41800:206"/> carcaſs of mine never fine enough; or on my body, I love to feaſt, and to have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the creatures; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is thy love; but is thy bounty to God, and things of Religion? Why then there is thy love. Take a man now that loves his belly, and he thinks nothing too much that he lays out upon it. Some of you have read the Hiſtory of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> who thought nothing too much, no coſts, no pains, ſo he might ſerve his belly: ſo <hi>Haman</hi> loved his revenge, and thought nothing too much for it. Pray examine where your bounty is; aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is your love. <hi>David</hi> when he was to build the Temple, he thought no coſt too much, but <hi>this I have done out of my poverty;</hi> this was
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:41800:206"/> an argument that the things of God carried the love of the man with them; this will prove the ſincerity of your love very much; do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and flatter your ſelves, I pray; tis a large heart that makes an open hand.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, love is laborious, it grudges no pains for the thing beloved; then where a mans love goeth, his labour goeth; therefore called <hi>the labour of love, Heb.</hi> 6. 10. and truly a man may conclude eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:41800:207"/> is, there is his labour, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Is it not of the Lord of hoſts, that the people labour in the fire, and weary themſelves?</hi> toilſom wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting labour, and labouring in vain, is called labouring in the fire: wicked men labour for vanity: what is that? why as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, they love vanity, and therefore they weary themſelves; for that you read of a man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4. 8. that <hi>there is no end of all his labour:</hi> why his love is endleſs to the things of this life; and therefore his labour is ſo: there is no end of his labour, his eye is not ſatisfied with riches: ſo the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> he loves God the Fathers buſineſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laboured till he had ſpent his natural ſtrength and <hi>radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moiſture, Humidum radicale,</hi>
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:41800:207"/> 
                     <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 49. 4. <hi>I have laboured in vain, and ſpent my ſtrength in vain.</hi> My brethren, a man that is ſlothfull, there is no love in that man: lazy love is pretended love; for where love is, and according to the degrees of it, ſuch will a mans labour be: you that finde dulneſs in duties, and the ways of God, you do not <hi>run the ways of Gods commands;</hi> ſtrengthen your love, and you will mend your pace; that is certain: now pray, look to your whole lives, and obſerve what your labour is laid out for. It is the obſervation of one of the Ancients, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpiritual one; <hi>Infra vires amor iniquus eſt: juxta exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guus non capit: at ad impoſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem tendit amor:</hi> love that doth not put forth it ſelf in ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:41800:208"/> labour, is unſound love; that which goes to its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſtrength, and no more, is true love, but weak love: do not tell me, tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my ſtrength: no, love tends to impoſſibilities, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in thoſe things which tis impoſſible for him to attain. Its obſerved of <hi>Mary,</hi> when ſhe came to Chriſts Sepulchre her love outbid her ſtrength; <hi>If you have taken away my Lord, tell me where you have laid him, and I will carry him away:</hi> would you know where your love is? examine where the labour of your life is; and conſider how much you have laboured for the things of this world: and how little for God and Chriſt; <hi>How little have I dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for wiſdom?</hi> pray by theſe Rules examine, where you
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:41800:208"/> have placed your love.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, would you know where your love is? Love is ventrous, it will hazard any thing for the thing beloved: Chriſt gives an evidence of it; he doth not only venture his life, but <hi>lay down his life;</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>love then this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friend, Joh.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>Abiſhai</hi> out of his intire love to <hi>David</hi> when there came <hi>Iſhbi-benob</hi> a gyant, whoſe ſtaff was like a Weavers beam, and ſtruck at <hi>David,</hi> thinking to have killed him: he interpoſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the blow, and ſlew the <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 16. Love is ventrous, it will put life in hazard for the thing beloved; tis that which the people of God ſpeak as a teſtimony of their love to God: <hi>The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi>
                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:41800:209"/>

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:41800:209"/> a feeble creature, how far out of love to her young will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard her ſelf againſt the moſt ravenous Bird? the mother, though a weak and fearfull creature, yet how far, and with how little conſideration will put her ſelf in hazard, if her childe be in danger? what is that for which you venture? Take a man whoſe love is ſet upon a luſt, what will that man hazard? he will loſe his friends, ſpend his eſtate, blaſt his reputation; nay he will venture his ſoul all this out of that curſed love; and indeed what is it elſe that makes men deſpiſe the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and mock at fear? what is it that men are ſo couragious for? tis their love to ſin makes them ſo: Now pray tell me where

                     </gap>hly, Love is zealous. I do not mean that of ſuſpition, a zeal of ſuſpition, that we commonly call jealouſie: <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicio eſt amicitiae venenum,</hi> tis the poiſon of love, that ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evil in the party belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: no, the property of love is the contrary; <hi>for love thinks no evil.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. But when I ſay love is zealous, my meaning is, it is full of ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, fearing leaſt any injury or wrong ſhould be offered to the perſon and thing beloved: this love is zealous againſt any injury offered to the thing or perſon beloved. Conſider, <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt man upon earth, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is turned into anger when an injury is done to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:41800:210"/> the God of his love, as well as of his life: <hi>Moſes by and by breaks the Tables:</hi> ſo likewiſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt out of love to his Father, <hi>the Zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up,</hi> Joh. 2. 17. Zeal in the heart is like boyling water, that waſtes in the ſeething: juſt ſo the Lord Jeſus, <hi>the Zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me up.</hi> It makes a man overlook all intereſts concerning himſelf in the world, and be intent only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the intereſt of the perſon beloved: ſo it is in Gods love. <hi>I am zealous for my ſanctuary with a very great jealouſie, Zach.</hi> 1, 14. What is zeal? It is a mixt affection; its nothing elſe but love provoked that is zeal. <hi>Eſther</hi> ſpeaks the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of love, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>How can I indure to ſee the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

Now pray tell me, what are you zealous for? Where is your zeal? touch one man in his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and you arm his zeal againſt you; touch another in point of goods, and you will quickly ſee where his love is: ſo on the contrary, touch God in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s Name, Chriſt in his truth, <hi>To whom I gave place, no not for an hour,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 5. preſently zeal is up, and love is provoked. I remember, it is <hi>Bernards</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to <hi>Eugenius, Igneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat Zelus:</hi> when any thing came contrary to the intereſt of Chriſt, he would have his zeal turn into fire: and ſo it
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:41800:211"/> will be where love is: exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine therefore what makes you hot upon every occaſion: ſure thats an injury done to the thing beloved: this is that which provokes thy zeal; therefore where thy zeal is, there is thy love.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Love is fearfull of ſeparation from the thing beloved: it deſires nothing more then union, it fears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then ſeparation: the Spouſe gives an inſtance of that in the <hi>Canticles; I charge you, awake not my love till he pleaſe: Auſtin</hi> gives that as the difference between true and unclean love: between the love of a wife, and the love of an harlot: ſo he puts it; both fear the husband: true, <hi>Haec ne veniat, illa ne diſcedat:</hi> the one fears leaſt the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:41800:212"/> ſhould come, the other fears leaſt he ſhould depart: this love wherever it is, fears ſeparation: the intireſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul in this world is unto the body: next to God and Chriſt, and heavenly things, there is the greateſt indeerment between the body and the ſoul. Now why is death called <hi>the King of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors?</hi> becauſe death is the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſoul from the body, which eſpecially the ſoul fears, becauſe union it loves: and as <hi>Neriemberg</hi> ſaith, <hi>A mans moritur ſibi, vivit in amato;</hi> he that loves, dies in himſelf, but lives in the thing beloved; for if a man die in himſelf, how loth were he to part with the thing beloved? for that were a double death: for this cauſe the great conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Saints is (let ſome
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:41800:212"/> men of our times talk what they will, that the Doctrine of falling from Grace, is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of great Conſolation: but) the Scripture and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience tells us, <hi>who ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rate us from the love of God? Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> for in the abſence of the thing beloved, the heart languiſhes, but in the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on from the thing beloved the heart dies: for this cauſe, as this is the greateſt cordial to the Saints, there is no ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they love that from which they ſhall never be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated: ſo its the greateſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive to wicked men: they love that from which there ſhall be a ſeparation; and therefore the Lord continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tels us, <hi>Riches betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their wings,</hi> Prov. 23. 5. <hi>Thou fool, this night I will take away thy ſoul,</hi> and then
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:41800:213"/> whoſe ſhall theſe things be? <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20. <hi>I will take thy cup from thy mouth: I will take you away with hooks, and your poſterity with fiſh-hooks,</hi> Amos 4. 2, 3. This I ſay, the greateſt corroſive to an ungodly man is, there ſhall be a perpetual ſeparation between him and the thing he loves: whereas the greateſt cordial to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, is the contrary; and therefore an ungodly man when he dies, his love dies, becauſe he is continually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the thing he loves; for love ceaſes in him, and all the comforts in the acts of it; ſo becauſe a godly man ſhall never be ſeparated from the thing he loves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a godly mans love ſhall be made perfect. I am afraid, ſaith one, I ſhall loſe my
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:41800:213"/> eſtate; another, I ſhall not die in honour: a third, I ſhall be cut off from ſuch a pleaſure that is the comfort of my life: by this you ſhall know your love: what you fear to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from, that the love of your hearts goes out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Love is victorious, <hi>love is ſtrong as death,</hi> Cant. 8. 6. Strong as death: why? ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>death hath raigned:</hi> here lies the ſtrength of death; it exerciſes ſuch dominion, as no man was ever able to ſtand out againſt its Scepter. No ſtanding out againſt it, there is a kinde of dominion in love. Conſider I pray, look unto the love that men bear to the things of this life: Let them have the riches of Chriſt, and the glory of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:41800:214"/> heaven tendred them, as the young man in the Goſpel had, <hi>Sell all that thou haſt, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven:</hi> the love of the world over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes; love is victorious: ſo on the other ſide, offer a godly man all the comforts of this life, whatſoever his heart could wiſh, yet not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his love to God outbids them all; for love is like lime in that reſpect, <hi>Many waters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quench it:</hi> no, the more water you pour upon it, the more it burns. Conſider I pray but that very inſtance of <hi>Luther,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Henry</hi> the eight King of <hi>England;</hi> he ſpeaks of the abominable ſlanders that were caſt upon him: for they did not ſpare him in that kinde; they that thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted for his blood did not
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:41800:214"/> ſpare to blaſt his name; but what doth he ſay of this? <hi>Si abſque animorum ſuorum damno fieri poſſet, ex omnibus talia au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direm: Lutherus paſcitur con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vitiis:</hi> the truth is, if this could be done without hurt to their own ſouls, I ſhould be glad if all the men in the world would lay as much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, as they could. By theſe reproaches, I am made fat: a man would have thought that this would have mightily cooled the mans zeal and earneſtneſs in the profeſſion of Religion, and the doctrine of the Goſpel; no, his love to truth overcame theſe: ſo pray conſider where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are you Conquerors; for not only <hi>faith overcomes the world,</hi> but love conquers the world: Examine, what prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:41800:215"/> ſo ever thou haſt made thee: it may be the great things of this world, honors, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, riches, reputation, and whatever elſe: but ſtill love to Chriſt, and the intereſt of Chriſt overcomes. Try your ſelves by theſe Rules: where the love is, there is the heart; where the heart is, there is the treaſure, and there is the heaven, and the happineſs: And ſo much for the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part. For the Application, there are three Uſes that I ſhall propoſe to you of it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is general, a Uſe of Inſtruction, in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from hence ſee the fulneſs of the Scriptures: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort ſentence you ſee how full of myſterie it is; the Jews
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:41800:215"/> have an ordinary Proverb a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, <hi>In lege non un a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula a qua magni non ſuſpenſi ſunt montes:</hi> there is not the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt things in Scripture, but there are great truths depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them: and therefore the Father cryes out, <hi>Adoro plenitudinem ſcripturae:</hi> that he did admire the fulneſs that he found in the Scriptures of God. I ſpeak it the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many things in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture we are apt to paſs over with a ſlight eye: It is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation one hath worth our note, <hi>Intoleranda eſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia aſſerere in Scriptura vel unum inveniri verbum otioſum:</hi> It is the greateſt blaſphemy that can be, to think that in the word of God there ſhould be found one idle word: he that will judge you for idle
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:41800:216"/> words, will not write one idle word unto you; that is certain: admire the fulneſs of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, from what you have heard. The Jews indeed were ſuperſtitious in this; they made great matters of every word and tittle in the Law: but what they did in a way Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtical, that you ſhould do in a way truly Chriſtian and ſpiritual; there is one place which becauſe <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in, I ſhall briefly hint to you; tis but barely to give you an inſtance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>Drink no longer water, but uſe a little wine for thy stomack ſake and for thy many infirmities. Chryſoſtom</hi> hath eight wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full great truths out of this ordinary Scripture: and I ſpeak it to this end, that you may paſs by nothing in the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:41800:216"/> Word, but that you may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to underſtand wonders in it: as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</p>
                  <p>Godly men out of love to duty, neglect the body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Godly men are very watchfull and moderate in the uſe of the creatures, leaſt they ſhould be brought under the power of them; they be great truths and clear in the Text, what need <hi>Timothy</hi> elſe to make a great ſcruple about drinking of wine, but he muſt drink water alſo?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider in this weakneſs, he did not ceaſe from his charge: he had infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, yea, open infirmities: but yet he did not neglect the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the affairs of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Godly men may
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:41800:217"/> yet too far neglect their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, even to offend therein: for he preſcribes him this, that argues he did not do his duty to repair the breaches made upon his body.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, uſe a little wine: every creature is good in its ſeaſon, yea thoſe creatures that commonly by men are moſt abuſed.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Godly men may be ſubject to great bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and often men of great ſervice: when ungodly men and of little or no uſe in the world, are healthy and ſtrong: yet many a man of great ſervice in the Church of God are ſubject to great and often infirmities.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, In the decay of Nature, the creatures are to be uſed for its repair, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:41800:217"/> to the proportion of natures neceſſities: and</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is a modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appointed in the receiving of the creature, even when a man doth it for neceſſity: for he that preſcribes him the wine, preſcribes him the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: drink a little wine: he preſcribes him to uſe herein as medicine. Now when men read over ſuch portions of Scripture, let them conſider and learn, there may be great myſteries in the ſmalleſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture: and know this, when the word of God upon this accompt becomes ſweet to a man, and men love to hear it, delight to meditate upon it, its a great argument of growth in grace, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual knowledge in that man: as <hi>Quintilian</hi> tels us, It is a
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:41800:218"/> great argument of a mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting in eloquence, the more pleaſure he takes in reading <hi>Cicero:</hi> its a great argument of a mans profit in ſpiritual knowledge, and growth in grace, when a man can take delight in reading and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Scriptures, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe he is alway a digging up new Mines, and finding new treaſure there: yet withal I would add this, do not only ſtudy the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Scripture: true, there is a man among you tels you, the Scripture is not to be found in the original, nor in the tranſlation out of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. I wonder where he will finde the Scripture then; he ſaith, only in the Saints. I pray conſider, I am ſure it was <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> minde, Do
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:41800:218"/> not only ſtudy the ſubſtance of the word, but the phraſes: for there are myſteries in the very expreſſions of Scripture: <hi>Non tantum verba ſunt, ſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Sancti verba:</hi> they are not only words, but ſuch words that the Spirit of God made choice of; <hi>for the holy men of God were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> not only for the ſenſe, but for the words; not the ſhorteſt ſentence in the word of God, but is full of myſterie; that is the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, though all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be to be ſtudied; yet ſome portions of Scripture a man ſhould eſpecially lay up in his heart, that the Spirit of God ſets, as it were, a ſtar upon: ſuch as this Scripture, is that we have been treating of. But there are</hi>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:41800:219"/> 
                     <hi>ſix Caſes the Scripture ſpeaks of, that the Lord puts eſpecial marks upon: As,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, thoſe that the Lord hath added a note of attention and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveration to:</hi> Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the ſins of the world: Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Verily, verily, except your righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of heaven. <hi>There be marks on ſuch places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, ſuch Scriptures as the Lord hath often repeated, ſuch ſhould be diligently ſtudied:</hi> The juſt ſhall live by faith: We are juſtified by faith, and not by the works of the Law; and riches profit not in the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:41800:219"/> day of wrath: <hi>three or four times repeated in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, beſides thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that God hath made uſe of in an eſpecial manner to do you or any others good; them God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires you eſpecially to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; as</hi> Auſtin <hi>was converted by,</hi> Rom. 13. 7. Not in cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring and wantonneſs, but put you on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Luther <hi>by</hi> Rom. 1. 17. The righteouſneſs of God was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from faith to faith. <hi>Junius</hi> by <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the Word, and the Word was God: <hi>Such Scriptures as the Lord hath made uſe of, to do thee or any other good, thoſe eſpecially he requires thee to mark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, eſpecially thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak concerning</hi>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:41800:220"/> 
                     <hi>thy condition: the Lord requires every man to ſtudie the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to his own eſtate: whether he be in proſperity or adverſity, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or diſgrace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak eſpecially to thy caſe.</hi> Nehemiah <hi>did ſo,</hi> Nehem. 1. 8. I beſeech thee remember the word that thou commandeſt thy ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, Ye will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and I will ſcatter you abroad among the people. But if you return, I will bring you to the place that I have choſen to place my name there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly, thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak to the preſent controverſie of the Age: the truths diſputed in the times wherein you live, that you may be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, thoſe Scriptures that</hi>
                     <pb n="383" facs="tcp:41800:220"/> 
                     <hi>are moſt comprehenſive, that carrie with them the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules to guide a mans life, ſuch as this in the Text,</hi> Where your treaſure is, your hearts will be: Bleſſed is the man that feareth always: Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the things that you have: God is a Spirit, and he that worſhips him, muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in Spirit and in truth: to be carnally minded is death, to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace: without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord. <hi>Theſe in an eſpecial manner the Lord requires you ſhould be exerciſed in, that</hi> theſe ſhould dwell richly in you: <hi>this is the general <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe from the whole words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to come more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, there are two Uſes more, that are more proper to this point we have ſpoken of.</p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:41800:221"/>
                  <p> Firſt, is the heart inſeparable from the treaſure? then this ſhews to every unregenerate man, that there is an abſolute neceſſity of converſion and regeneration. You have many poor carnal creatures, and they complain, I cannot keep my thoughts in order: my heart runs out ſometimes after this, and ſometimes after that thing. I have no command of the aims and ſtudies of the heart, and the thoughts, and love of my heart: alas very true; what commands the heart? why, the treaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the heart; therefore untill thou change thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, thy heart will go after it: what is Converſion? its the change of a mans Treaſure, of a mans Chief good: till thou change thy chief good, its in
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:41800:221"/> vain to complain of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of thy heart; therefore every unregenerate man may hence ſee the abſolute neceſſity of Converſion; now the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie of that man, whoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is on earth, becauſe his heart is there, is ſeen in two things: and I ſpeak it to this end, that I may ſtir up every one to examine his eſtate, that if thou finde thy ſelf unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, never give reſt to thy ſelf until thy treaſure be changed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let thy actions be what they will, if thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be below, thy heart will be there; and therein lies a mans miſery; a temporary believer may go far in the change of his actions; but his heart is the ſame, as long as his treaſure is the ſame. <hi>Simon</hi>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:41800:222"/> 
                     <hi>Magus</hi> his acts changed much, he confeſſed ſin, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the faith of Chriſt; but yet notwithſtanding, his heart is not changed: why? his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was not changed: money was his treaſure when he was a Sorcerer, and is now he is a Chriſtian, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 21. this is the miſery of every unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man; let him change his actions while he will, there is no change of his heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his treaſure is the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a further miſery; this is the ground of the greateſt bondage to him in the world; let the man be convinced by never ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reaſon out of the word of God, that his ſtate is naught, that his ways are evil; let him finde by wofull experience
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:41800:222"/> terrors upon his own ſoul, that it is ſo, let him reſolve ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo firmly againſt it, yet the man will never ſtop; tis in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: unregenerate men take up high reſolutions, but they are held; the heart cannot leave its courſe: ſo that <hi>all their righteouſneſs is but like the morning dew:</hi> and their purpoſes are ſoon broken off: and let a man be of never ſo high reſolution, and under high conviction; this will keep off a mans heart ſtill; thou art a miſerable man then, that haſt thy treaſure on earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there thy heart is: there is an abſolute neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the change of a mans treaſure, that is, of a work of regeneration: otherwiſe there is a treaſure within, <hi>an evil man out of an evil heart,</hi> and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:41800:223"/> there is a treaſure without: oh pray therefore learn from hence, that there is no living in an unregenerate eſtate: change thy treaſure, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways all thy changes will do thee no good.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Uſe I eſpecially aim at: ſee from hence the bleſſed and happy condition of a godly man, whoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is in heaven: he is bleſſed every way, but eſpecially in this: his heart is in heaven, his body is on earth: its true: and there is a two fold bleſſedneſs upon this account.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let this man at any time go aſtray, as godly men are ſubject to wander: <hi>Oh let me not wander from thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Pſal.</hi> 119. 10. <hi>We all as ſheep have gone aſtray:</hi> but when they do wander, there is
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:41800:223"/> ſomewhat ſtill to reduce them: their hearts will to their treaſure: my treaſure is not below; therefore my heart is not below, and this is the true reaſon, why a godly man cannot fall from grace; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the heart and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; where the treaſure is, there will the heart be: <hi>I will return unto my former husband:</hi> as it is the miſery of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man, let him profeſs what he will, his treaſure will bring him back again ſtill: ſo its the happineſs of a godly man, though he wander from God, his treaſure will reduce him, and his heart will bring him back.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is a bleſſed man, who hath his heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in heaven; certainly he
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:41800:224"/> muſt needs be a happy man, for he is a heavenly man: but now a godly man, whoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is in heaven, his heart is there: but why is he ſo happy a man, whoſe heart is in heaven?</p>
                  <p>I will give you a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: truly, there are four accounts, why he is ſo happy a man whoſe treaſure is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe his heart is there.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe he is hereby made and evidenced to be a heavenly man. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 48. <hi>the firſt man is of the earth earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the ſecond man is of the Lord from heaven heavenly:</hi> here is the difference between all the men in the world: there are ſome earthly, and ſome heavenly men: now this is an evidence thou art an heavenly man, becauſe thy treaſure is in heaven; as that wiſdom that
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:41800:224"/> is converſant about earth is ſaid to be <hi>earthly wiſdom:</hi> ſo that wiſdom w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is converſant about heaven is ſaid to be <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wiſdom:</hi> my brethren, an earthly minde is a plague; an heavenly mind is a bleſſednes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he that hath his heart in heaven, is not ſubject to thoſe impreſſions of change as the men whoſe hearts are ſet upon earth; Here every thing is ſubject to change, and we have nothing but changes: <hi>Changes and War are againſt me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job:</hi> but if a mans eſtate and condition change, ſo his heart do not change, it is no great matter; my heart is not ſubject to change: as I remember <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerves of the Chriſtians of his time, <hi>Nil crus ſentit in nervo, ſi ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in coelo:</hi> true indeed, they
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:41800:225"/> were under great afflictions of body, but their ſouls were in heaven out of danger: the heart is out of danger; its true of a man whoſe heart is in heaven: and his heart is out of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot; afflictions may work on the body, make a change in the eſtate and outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but his heart is above and out of danger; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people of God are ſaid to be <hi>thoſe that dwell in heaven,</hi> Rev. 13. 6. <hi>they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the tabernacle of God, and their names who were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heaven:</hi> the heart chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not for any evil, becauſe its bound up in an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, he is a happy man whoſe heart is in heaven, becauſe where his heart is, his life will be, and his converſation.</hi> Phil.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:41800:225"/> 3. 20, 21. Our converſation is in heaven: <hi>now</hi> keep thy heart above all keepings, for out of it are the iſſues of life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23, 24. <hi>Therefore if a mans heart be on the earth, his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation will be below; but if his heart be in heaven, there his life and converſation will be; now when other men are making great ado here below, his heart all the while is taken up about God as his Father, about Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, the Spirit as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, the Angels as his fellow Subjects, the ſouls of juſt men made perfect his fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. Oh what a happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth this man live in! his heart being in heaven, his life is there.</hi>

                     <hi>Laſtly, it is a clear evidence to aman, that his heart being in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, his body ſhall ſhortly be there:</hi>

It is gone to heaven as the forerunner of the body; and as Chriſts Aſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an argument of our aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo the aſcention of the heart is a clear argument that the whole man ſhall be there where the heart is,</hi> that they may be taken up together with the Lord in the clouds of heaven: <hi>Oh what a Comfort is this! no man is a happy man, but he who hath his heart in heaven, and his treaſure there.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to put me upon that ſad ſervice of Preaching at the Funeral of your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and dear Paſtor; And ſhortly after that, upon
<pb facs="tcp:41800:229"/> another ſervice of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I then had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely Preached; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I never Preached a Sermon (in this kind) with more grief of heart, and never did I diſcern a Sermon heard and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more weeping eyes: certainly God had given in unto him the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of many perſons, who loved him in his life, and bitterly lamented him at his death.</p>
                  <p>I was almoſt fallen out with the thoughts of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing any occaſional Sermons, as being moſt
<pb facs="tcp:41800:229"/> proper for ſcope, and uſe, and working, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Auditory: But your general deſire hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon me to deny my own judgement; and ſince it muſt be ſo, here you have thoſe ſudden and weak fruits (ſuch as they are) and the bleſsing of the Lord go with them.</p>
                  <p>Of what other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they may be (beſides the keeping up a while the name and memory of ſo pretious a ſervant of Chriſt) I know not; but yet I truſt thar God may
<pb facs="tcp:41800:230"/> intend them, and now doth ſend them abroad for the good of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p>Of this I am ſure, that every perſonal change in the world is an effect of his Providence; and that there is a Doctrinal will for the living, in every providential will of God concerning the dead; and the greater that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in his relation of uſefulneſs and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to Chriſt and his Church, the more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical <hi>Selah</hi> doth the Lord (in the removal of
<pb facs="tcp:41800:230"/> him) print out for the children of men.</p>
                  <p>There was honey found by <hi>Sampſon</hi> in the carcaſe of the dead Lyon; ſo are there many ſweet inſtructions and leſſons to be gathered, not only out of the lives, but alſo out of the deaths of the Miniſters of Chriſt. The laſt Sermon which a people are to ſtudy, and diligently to peruſe, is the death of their Godly Paſtor; for in this God himſelf doth immediatly preach unto them.</p>
                  <p>As when Miniſters do
<pb facs="tcp:41800:231"/> live, it is but hypocriſie to give them only a few good words: ſo when they dye, it is but a forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity only to ſhed over them a few ſad tears.</p>
                  <p>O that you your ſelves, (and the many other Congregations) who of late have carried their Faithful and Laborious Miniſters to the grave, would ſeriouſly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that you muſt anſwer God for the quick and for the dead, for your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and for your dead <hi>Ministers:</hi> there are living uſes to be made
<pb facs="tcp:41800:231"/> out of dead inſtances: Live, and live the better, live up to the power of Truth and Godlineſs, live like ſuch as are even part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with life, and in haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard about a ſeaſon: Live like ſuch who did enjoy, and who again would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a choice ſervant to your <hi>Miniſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though Miniſters die, yet Chriſt lives, and he is preſent with you, and he obſerves all your heart and ways: therefore as you formerly have, ſo now eſpecially ſtrive to abound much more in
<pb facs="tcp:41800:232"/> heavenly wiſdom, in ſound Judgement, in Faith and Love to our Lord Jeſus, in meekneſs, and gentleneſs, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs one towards another, and in all exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of holy walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your God; hereupon ſhall you finde your late great loſs gratiouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the anſwer of your fervent prayers: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhall you finde the teſtimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; hereupon ſhall you finde peace in death, and after that, the Crown of life, which God will give
<pb facs="tcp:41800:232"/> to all that love him.</p>
                  <p>And for other People, let them repent of the evil handling of their Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters, and beſeech the Lord to give them hearts in their day of Grace, yet to know the things which do concern their Peace; which that we all may do, ſhall be the prayer of</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>IN the former verſe, <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> are paſſing on,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:41800:234"/> and diſcourſing together: What that Diſcourſe was, it is not expreſſed.

                  <p>Whiles they were thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, on a ſudden <hi>there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a Charet of fire, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>

                     <hi>a whirlwind into heaven.</hi> By the <hi>Charet and horſes of fire, Peter Martyr</hi> underſtands the Angels of God, who at this time did put on the ſpecies or appearance of <hi>fire:</hi> And with this <hi>fiery</hi> Apparition God was
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:41800:234"/> pleaſed to honour <hi>Elijah</hi> at his departure: who in his life time had ſo much honoured his God with the <hi>fire</hi> of Zeal for his Truth and Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he went up by a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind into heaven.</hi> Some do read it, <hi>that he went up by a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde of heaven,</hi> or by an <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly whirlwinde:</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the manner of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion: but our general Tranſlation and Reading is beſt, which doth more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly denote the place unto which he was then carried, Namely, Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Therefore that opinion of the Papiſts is very fond: who do affirm that <hi>Elijah was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Paradiſe,</hi> there to ſtay with <hi>Enoch</hi> until towards the end of the world, and then both of them are to come

But this is a meer fancy all along: the Text ſaith plainly, <hi>Elijah went up by a Whirlwind into heaven.</hi> But what heaven he went into is ſomewhat argued, eſpecially by the Papiſts, who it ſeems will by no means have that zealous enemy to idolatry to be carried into the heaven of the bleſſed: There is indeed <hi>Coelum Aerium</hi> (the Aery Heaven, where the Fowls of Heaven do flee) and there is <hi>Coelum Aſtriferum,</hi> where the Stars of heaven are; and there is <hi>Coelum Beatorum,</hi> the heaven of the Bleſſed, where God appears in eminency, and where Jeſus Chriſt is in glory, and the ſouls of juſt men made perfect; thither is <hi>Elijah</hi> carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, after all his pains, and

                  <p>There are two Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons onely which I would briefly diſcourſe upon from this Text, at this time, and with reſpect to this ſad occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That even the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Faithfull and Zealous Prophets of God, may be,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:41800:237"/> and ſhall be taken away from a people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the loſs of any one eminently Faithful and Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Prophet of God, ſhould affect the hearts of people with exceeding Grief and Lamentation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I begin with the firſt of theſe:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> 
                     <hi>That even the moſt eminently Faithfull and Zealous Prophets of God, may be, and ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from a people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophets or Miniſters of God, they are of different parts and gifts, and they are of different Spirits, and they are of different Uſe and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Put them in compariſon one with another, ſome are as Stars of the firſt Magnitude, and others of a leſſer Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: ſome are as the Cedars, and others are but as ordinary
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:41800:237"/> trees: Some are more rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">As <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, Paul, Calvin</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                     </note> and plentifully endowed and furniſhed; others are not ſo, they are lower by the head: ſome are vigorouſly active, and are raiſed up, and laid out for the general Advantages and Managements of Religion; yet others are not ſo; though all be Builders, yet all of them are not Maſter-builders. They differ much in their Gifts, in their Graces, in their Services, <note place="margin">Gifts will free from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; Grace from hell, but nothing from death.</note> in their Uſefulneſs: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they muſt all agree in this, they muſt all dye, they muſt all be taken away: Here in the text, <hi>Elijah was taken away,</hi> and what was he? he was a Prophet, and in ſome ſenſe more then a Prophet: He was a Prophet of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rate, moſt eminent for faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and zeal, (that was his
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:41800:238"/> excellency) <hi>Noah</hi> was eminent for uprightneſs, and <hi>Moſes</hi> for meekneſs, and <hi>Job</hi> for patience, and <hi>Solomon</hi> for wiſdom, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> for proweſs, and <hi>Joſiah</hi> for tenderneſs, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> for Miracles, and <hi>Elijah</hi> for zeal, and courage, and faithfulneſs. All the falſe Prophets were nothing to him, nor <hi>Jezabel</hi> the Queen, nor <hi>Ahab</hi> the King: and although (in his opinion) he was left alone to ſuſtain the cauſe of God; yet he alone continued faithfull and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Nevertheleſs this holy and excellent man of God is taken away, and ſuddenly, and in a very needfull time.</p>
                  <p>Zach. 1. 5. <hi>Your Fathers, where are they? And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, do they live for ever?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, no, they do not <hi>live for ever;</hi> Nor yet (many times)
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:41800:238"/> very long! You may finde them for a while in the Study, and for a while in the Pulpit, and after a little while you may finde them in their graves.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons of this Divine <note place="margin">4. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why God takes away his moſt faithful prophets</note> diſpenſation (beſides many other) are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe even the moſt faithful Prophets of God, are Stewards but for a time; of them as well as of others it muſt be ſaid, Ye ſhall be no longer Stewards: they have their determined work, and their allotted time for that work; their reward ſhall be meaſured by eternity. But their work and their life are mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by time; ſo much work for ſo much time, and then their Maſter calls them home.</p>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:41800:239"/>
                  <p> In Scripture you read that they are ſometimes called <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> who are choice perſons ſent abroad by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Commiſſion; and when they have finiſhed their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or Treaty, then muſt they return back unto their Prince; the Prophets or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God, are the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of God in a ſpecial manner, Authorized to treat with ſinners to be reconciled; perhaps ſinners will hearken unto them, and conclude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on terms of ſaving agreement; perhaps they will not: Theſe have but their time to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and they have but their time to offer and perſwade, and when that is expired, the Lord calls them home.</p>
                  <p>Again, you finde them <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 9.</note> ſometimes called labourers
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:41800:239"/> and workmen; the labourer goes forth in the morning, and he does his days work, which when he hath finiſhed, then he comes home and takes his Reſt. Thus it is, and thus it ſhall be with the beſt of Gods Prophets and Miniſters, who are alſo called the Meſſengers of God, and muſt return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him an anſwer, what they have done, and how they have ſped.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for them, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is with the Lord, they are imployed by a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and as there are the works of faithful ſervants for them to do, ſo there is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a faithful maſter for them to receive: there is a Prophets work here, and a Prophets reward hereafter;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:41800:240"/> Chriſts cals it our Maſters joy, and <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a Crown of Righteouſneſs; the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and laborious Miniſters of God, though deſpiſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by men on earth, yet they are loved and encouraged by Chriſt: and as they are a means to ſave others, ſo they themſelves ſhall be ſaved, and ſhall ſhine as the ſtars for ever and ever, they ſhall be with the Lord for ever, they ſhall be everlaſtingly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>And therefore they muſt die, they muſt away: elſe they cannot take poſſeſſion of the inheritance reſerved for them, nor of the Crown laid up for them; indeed in this life they have the aſſured hopes of eternal bleſſedneſs, and the firſt fruits, and ſome
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:41800:240"/> taſts; but the ful &amp; perfect poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and fruition comes not to them, nor to any in this life: that comes only after death; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> deſires to be diſſolved, and ſo to be with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord doth this to puniſh the ingratitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who do deſpiſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and deſpightfully uſe his ſervants, the Prophets, injuriouſly handle them, and there is no man that will plead for them, and right them.</p>
                  <p>Of all the men in the world, the faithful Prophets of God do the moſt good to others, and finde the worſt reception from them.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt chargeth this unworthy dealing upon Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. <hi>O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt</hi>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:41800:241"/> 
                     <hi>the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee!</hi> And Stephen chargeth it upon them, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 52. <hi>Which of the Prophets have not your Fathers perſecuted?</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>We are made as the filth of the world, and are the off-ſcouring of all things to this very day.</hi> Men do affront and contemn, they do revile and reproach, they do oppoſe and contradict, they do threaten and perſecute the faithful Prophets of God: and thoſe of them who are moſt faithful and moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, are moſt hated and moſt perſecuted.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord will not bear with this odious ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and with this barbarous injuriouſneſs done unto his faithful ſervants; he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:41800:241"/> ſenſible of all the evil done unto them, of all the evil words ſpoken againſt them, and of all the evil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and devices taken againſt them, and of all the evil works done againſt them: <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, and do</hi>

                     <hi>my Prophets no harm,</hi> ſaith God: <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And therefore he takes away his choice Prophets and Servants in Judgement, from ſuch an ungracious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful people, in effect ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them thus much; <hi>Ye will not be taught, and you ſhall not be taught any more; and you will not hearken unto my meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but mock and deſpiſe them: therefore they ſhall ſpeak no more unto you in my name; your houſe ſhall be left unto you deſolate. Ye</hi>

                     <hi>ſhall not ſee me henceforth</hi> (ſaid <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 39.</note> Chriſt) <hi>till ye ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Lord takes away his moſt eminently faithfull and zealous Prophets from a people, is this, To ſhew unto a people the uncertainty and inſtability even of ſpiritual op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, that they are but a ſeaſon (which is pretious, but unſure) that they are a ſhort day, and a Sun that may ſet at noon day.</p>
                  <p>There are four things which do admit of much uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is, all our earthly poſſeſſions and comforts; <hi>wilt thou ſet thine eyes on that which is not?</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 23. 5. There is no earthly comfort
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:41800:242"/> whatſoever, which is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uncertain, nay alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uncertainty; it is but as the ſhade on the Dyal, on which you look, and may be gone before you turn back to look on it again.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, The gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious motions of the Spirit of God working upon our ſpirits: <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man,</hi> Gen. 6. 3. <hi>Rara Hora, Brevis mora,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard.</hi> The dealings of Gods Spirit with us, are many times like <hi>Peters</hi> viſion of the ſheet, which was let down, but quickly drawn up to heaven again; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no man who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts or neglects any one moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Spirit, but he puts it upon an uncertainty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall meet with any other motion more.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="416" facs="tcp:41800:243"/> 3. The third is, the day of Grace, our Goſpel-day, wherein Chriſt reveals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and offers himſelf, and mercy, and peace, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this is a day for eternity, but it is not an eternal day: It may quickly be loſt, and for ever loſt. <hi>O if thou hadſt known</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem) <hi>even Thou, at the leaſt in this thy day, the things which concern thy peace—But now</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>they are hid from thine eyes: q. d.</hi> Thou hadſt thy day, and now thou haſt loſt thy day.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth is, all the lifes, and pains, and labours of the Prophets and Miniſters of God, they are all fluent and uncertain.</p>
                  <p>This day the Miniſter lives and preaches, the next day he is ſick and dyes; you cannot
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:41800:243"/> ſay of the beſt Miniſter on earth, he ſhall be ours for ever, or long, or a week, or a day: ſuch an inſtability is there, not only in the beſt of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, but alſo in the beſt of our ſpiritual helps.</p>
                  <p>And there is much of the wiſdom of God in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular contingency; he hath his good ends in it, to awaken the hearts of people from carnal ſecurity and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, from all careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and neglects, and to ſtir and quicken them to all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſeriouſneſs, and wiſe carefulneſs, both to know the day of their viſitation, and likewiſe to improve the light, whiles they enjoy the light.</p>
                  <p>There are two works upon which all ſpiritual uncertainties (in Friends or Miniſters) ſhould put us.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="418" facs="tcp:41800:244"/> 1. One is therefore to prize what is preſent; there is no certainty but in that which is preſent; that is ours, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that is ours: the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sermon, that is ours, and the preſent offer of Chriſt; prize what is preſent; for the future is uncertain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another is therefore to act with all our power, to do as much in a little time as others are doing in a long time. Nay, to be ſtriving and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring up in a little time ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, and ſo diligently, as if we had no more time.</p>
                  <p>There is an uncertainty in the lives of Gods Prophets; therefore people ſhould ply their doctrine, and their help with all their ſtrength; hear them as if they ſhould never hear them more, and confer
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:41800:244"/> and draw from them, as if they ſhould never ſpeak with them any more: but more of this in the Uſes now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>May and doth God tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <note place="margin">Vſe 1. <hi>A double adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement.</hi>
                     </note> even an <hi>Elijah?</hi> doth he take away the moſt eminently faithful and zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? Hence a double adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement. 1. One to Miniſters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other to People.</p>
                  <p>Firſt to Miniſters; loyter not, loſe no time, ſtand not idle at all, up and be doing your Maſters work; do not talk of this pain, and of that ach, nor of this weakneſs, nor of that indiſpoſition, but ſpend and be ſpent, be inſtant in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and out of ſeaſon, watch and labour, pray and inſtruct, reprove and comfort, pull down, and build up, always
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:41800:245"/> abounding in the work of the Lord. O ſaid that eminently religious, and judicious <hi>Calvin,</hi> (who had worn himſelf to the very bone with often praying, and ſtudying, and preaching, and writing; and therefore being entreated by his friends a little to ſpare himſelf, no ſaith he, but I deſire that when my Maſter comes, he ſhould finde me working: And ſo that precious <hi>Jewel,</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <note place="margin">Nec pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendi perdere finem.</note> was that he might die preaching: And learned and pious <hi>Reynolds,</hi> he would not loſe time; he lookt at the end of life, more then at life it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>O Brethren! Ye alſo have but your day, ye have but your day to ſerve the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ye have but your day to ſave your own
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:41800:245"/> ſouls; and ye have but your day to ſave the ſouls of them that hear you: And your day of working ſeems to be more variable and contingent then the day of other men; for if ye be impartially faithful, and zealous, ye ſhall be ſure to meet with all diſcouragements and oppoſitions from all ſorts of ungodly men: who if they cannot ſtop your mouths, will yet do all they can to break your hearts. And beſides that your conſtant ſtudies, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent labours, and publike preachings, and private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and ſeveral other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, will weaken your ſpirits, ſpend your lungs, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſume your ſtrength, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten your death.</p>
                  <p>However, the Lord will take you away, and perhaps
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:41800:246"/> he will come and take you away ſuddenly: therefore be diligent ſtill, and laborious ſtill, and faithful ſtill, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtill, and wiſe ſtill, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto every ſervant his proper portion. <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter comes, he ſhall find ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> this is he who ſhall meet with that welcome, <hi>well done, good and faithfull ſervant, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly to the People; Seeing that their faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Miniſters ſhall be taken away from them, let them remember two things for their parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let them encourage faithful and zealous Prophets, who do enjoy them: O do not kill them, and break their hearts, and thruſt them into
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:41800:246"/> their graves by ſlightings, by revilings, by quarrellings, by troublings, by remaining ſtill ignorant, and unprofitable, and barren; nor by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſtinate, diſobedient, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and unbelieving.</p>
                  <p>No, by no means, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, and love them, and deal kindly with them, and pray for them, and encourage them all you can. Why Sirs, They do pitty your ſouls, and they do watch for your ſouls, and they do pray for your ſouls, and they do ſtudy and weep, and preach to ſave your ſouls. And therefore let them have love for love, and care for care, and reſpect for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; they give you bread, do not give them ſtones; they bring mercies to you, do not you caſt your curſes upon
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:41800:247"/> them; they attend to your ſalvation, and peace, and comfort; do not requite them evil for good, but let them have good for good, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Improve their preſent <note place="margin">They are g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to you, and for you, they are your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> ſurvivance, and your own preſent freedom: O it is a naughty frame of ſpirit to praiſe the dead, but not to prize the living; To ſet out with a large commendation the manifold vertues and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Miniſters that are dead; yet not to regard, nor make uſe of the parts and pains of thoſe that are living, and preaching unto us.</p>
                  <p>But let us be more wiſe: <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> here is found travelling and conferring with <hi>Elijah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is taken away: Now you may hear your Miniſters inſtructing and perſwading
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:41800:247"/> you, but within a ſhort time you ſhall never ſee, nor hear them more. Now you may go unto them, and open your doubts, and diſcover your ſouls wants, and diſeaſes, and crave their Counſel, and take their Directions, &amp; partake of their Inſtructions, and receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts by them; But within a ſhort time they are changing, and fainting, and dying, and giving up the Ghoſt, and can never be inſtrumental to your ſouls any more!</p>
                  <p>O loſe not your Tide, and loſe not your Spiritual oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Every faithful and godly Miniſter is like a garden in the Spring-time, and the people ſhould be like ſo many Bees, flying every day unto the Flowers in that garden, to ſuck out the honey, and carry
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:41800:248"/> it home to the Hive.</p>
                  <p>You may now get that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, that direction, that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction about the condition of your ſouls, which may ſtick by you all the days of your life.</p>
                  <p>Remember Sirs! As it will be an heavy Judgement if you make no uſe of your faithful Miniſters, ſo it will cut you to the very heart when your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are dead (and then can be of no more uſe unto you) that you made ſo little uſe of them living, that you traded ſo ſlightly, that you have been ſuch ſtrangers to them, that you did not enrich your ſouls by them. O that people, who do enjoy able and faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, were (then) poſſeſſed of two Graces; one is of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, to ſee their own wants; the other is of wiſdom, to ſee
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:41800:248"/> their ſeaſon for the ſupply of them: <hi>Wherefore is there a price put into the hand of a fool, ſeeing he hath no heart to make uſe of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I finiſhed the firſt Propoſition; namely, That even the moſt eminently faithful and zealous Prophets of God may be, and ſhall be taken away from a people: I now proceed to the ſecond Propoſition, which is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the loſs of any one emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</note> 
                     <hi>faithful and Zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God, ſhould affect the hearts of the people of God with much grief and lamentation: (my Father, my Father; the Charet of Iſrael, and the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thereof!)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> that eminent Prophet died (there aroſe not a prophet ſince in <hi>Iſrael</hi> like unto <hi>Moſes) The children of</hi>
                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:41800:249"/>

                     <hi>of Moab thirty days; So the days of weeping and mourning for Moſes were ended.</hi> When <hi>Samuel,</hi> that faithful and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Prophet died, what a mourning &amp; lamentation was made for him: <hi>Samuel died, and all the Iſraelites were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>together and lamented him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like you read of <hi>Steven, Devout men carried Steven to his burial, and made great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations over him.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 8. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three things which do concern us, when God takes away any faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants of his.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is a ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the hand of God in this: for though their death be a mercy unto them, <hi>(Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord.</hi>
                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:41800:249"/> 
                     <hi>And precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 14. 13. Pſa. 116. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Saints.)</hi> Yet their death may be a Judgement to us.</p>
                  <p>As a godly Miniſters life and doctrine is either <hi>in Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> or <hi>in Judicium,</hi> either they are the ſavour of life unto life, or they are the ſavour of death unto death: So the loſs of them is certainly an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to themſelves, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily it is a judgement and puniſhment unto a people: And therefore we ſhould not ſlightly paſs over their death, but conſider, and lay ſuch ſtrokes of God to our hearts, <hi>The living will lay it to his heart:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 2.</note> Surely he ſhould, ſurely he will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is a prudent reflexion upon our ſelves; what there is in our ſelves which
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:41800:250"/> hath contributed unto ſo great a loſs: for not only diſeaſes in a Miniſter, but alſo ſins in a people may have a great hand to take away the life of their Miniſter; and therefore there is reaſon for us to reflect and ſearch.</p>
                  <p>In every ordinary loſs that befals us, we ſhould ſearch our hearts, and try our ways, and ſay, Why is this evil come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us? much more ſhould this be done, when a Spiritual loſs befals us; <hi>When the Lord takes away from us the ſtaff and the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa 3. 1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>ſtay, the Judge and the Prophet.</hi> When he ſmites the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and the ſheep are like to be ſcattered; when he removes his Angels from his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                  <p>Now is it a time to ſtand ſtill, and to gather our ſelves
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:41800:250"/> together, and to ſay, What have we been? and what have we done? how have we walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? what hath been our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment under the Goſpel? what our anſwerableneſs thereunto? hath not our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs, hath not our barrenneſs, hath not our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard, hath not our diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience cauſed the Lord to make this breach? to take away the light from us?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is a mournful Lamentation; we ſhould be very ſenſible of ſuch a loſs: yea, in ſome proportion unto the kind and greatneſs of it: For as the enjoyment of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently faithful Prophet (or Paſtor) is an exceeding bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing (it is promiſed amongſt the chiefeſt of mercies, <hi>I will give them Paſtors after mine own</hi>
                     <pb n="432" facs="tcp:41800:251"/> 
                     <hi>heart, and thine eyes ſhall ſee thy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Teacher.)</hi> So the death of ſuch a one is an exceeding loſs, and conſequently requires ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Grief and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>There are ſix great loſſes, <note place="margin">Six great loſſes.</note> and do you judge whether they be not ſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is the loſs of a ſoul, how great is that loſs? all is loſt if that be loſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is the loſs of true Religion; and the glory is departed from Iſrael, when that is gone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is the loſs of Gods ſmiling favour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; when that withdraws, then the Sun is ſet, and it is night, and darkneſs, and fear, and trouble with the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth is the loſs of peace in conſcience; now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:41800:251"/> the wars and tumults, and the bones are broken.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth is the loſs of the Goſpel; now the gates of heaven are ſhut up, and the worſt of famines ſeizeth our ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth is the loſs of faithful Prophets, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God; now the ſtones are fallen, and the ſhields of the earth are fallen, and the interpreters, the men of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and the watch-men ſet upon the Towers, and Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, are cut off, and the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, and of peace are called home, and the ſervants and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our ſalvation are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
                  <p>Now the more that any loſs borders upon ſouls, and upon ſalvation, the more heavy and

                  <p>Q. <hi>But may ſome ſay, why all this ado? Why ſuch a crying out, and ſuch a laying to heart, ſuch a grieving and mourning, and taking on, and troubling of our ſelves upon the loſs and death of faithful and zealous Prophets? What are they more then other men, for place, for uſe, for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that there muſt be ſuch a ſtir for them?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> So indeed did <hi>Ahab</hi> ſpeak of gracious and zealous <hi>Elijah; Ahab</hi> (who ſold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to work wickedneſs in the ſight of the Lord) he ſaid thus unto <hi>Elijah, Art thou he that troubleth Iſrael?</hi> But to
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:41800:252"/> let railers go, there are two Reaſons to be found in the Text for a mournful lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon the death of the faithful Miniſters or Prophets of God; whereof one reſpects the people of God, who ſtood in relation unto them, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto a father, and the Prophets ſtood in relation to them as fathers unto children; and the other Reaſon reſpects the publike civil State.</p>
                  <p>1. In reſpect of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and a People.</p>
                  <p>Their Relation is that of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Children (my Father, my Father, cries Eliſha here)</hi> and truly this Relation hath in it more of Love, and more of Grief then any other Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when <hi>Joſeph</hi> buried <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> his Father, <hi>They mourned</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now every faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or Miniſter of God is a Father unto the Saints or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Spiritual generation: under God he is a Spiritual Father, and begets them again by the Goſpel; this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſly delivers in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places.</p>
                  <p>1 Cor. 4. 15. <hi>Though you have ten thouſand Inſtructers in Chriſt, yet have ye not many Fathers; for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> He was an Inſtrument or means uſed by God for their New-birth.

                  <p n="2">2. For loving and tender affection; a Father doth not more love his Natural childe, then the faithful Miniſter doth thoſe whom he hath begotten unto Chriſt: <hi>Take thine only Son Iſaac whom thou loveſt,</hi> ſaid God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. 2. <hi>The Elder unto the Elect Lady and her children, whom I love in the Truth.</hi> 2 Joh. 1.

                  <p>Nay, ſo great is the love of benevolence in a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto his people, That he is contented for a while to delay his own eternal ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and happineſs, that he may be a little more helpful and uſeful unto his people; this prevalent affection you may read expreſly in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtles difficulty and ſtreight was about his own perſonal intereſt, and their common ſpiritual good. If I die, I ſhall gain by death, I ſhall be with Chriſt: But then you will loſe; I muſt no more be with you, to ſerve, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Faith and Joy: well ſaith he, I am content, I am willing to live a little longer for the beneficial ſervice of your ſouls, rather then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to depart and enjoy my happineſs with Chriſt: O what a love was this?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For care and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; how careful is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his children?

This like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is applied unto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of God: they do naturally care for the eſtate of their People, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 20. As if they were led thereunto by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bowels, and by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtinct: and they are watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them, and over them. Heb. 13. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls:</hi> Ah Brethren! when you are ſleeping, they are watching; when you are minding your Trades, then are they ſtudying your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when you are following
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:41800:255"/> your delights, then are they mourning and praying for your ſouls: they are caring and watching how to get your hearts changed, how to bring in your ſouls to Chriſt, how to get your ſins mortified, your temptations anſwered, your doubts reſolved, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to be ſetled and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: they fear in your fears, and they are troubled in your troubles, they mourn in your ſorrows, they rejoyce in your peace, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For all the offices and duties of a Father: you read in Scripture of the ſeveral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Father. As firſt, Inſtruction and Direction. Secondly, Repro of and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Thirdly, Compaſſion and Comfort. Fourthly, Proviſion and Expences. In
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:41800:256"/> all theſe doth every faithful and zealous Miniſter of God abundantly appear, and put forth himſelf: He inſtructs the ignorant, directs the doubtful, warns &amp; reproves the unruly, pitties the weak, comforts thoſe that are caſt down, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides food of all ſorts for his people, milk for Babes, and meat for thoſe of full age: <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 14. 2 Cor. 13. 11.</note> lays out himſelf, ſpends and is ſpent; lays out all his received treaſure, and ſtock of ſpiritual goods amongſt them; is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved if his children walk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Goſpel: and nothing doth more rejoyce him then to ſee them walking in the truth, and proſpering in Chriſt: As his firſt great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is to match every one of them to Chriſt, ſo his next great endeavor is that they
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:41800:256"/> may abound with all the fruits of righteouſneſs which are by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now judge what the loſs of ſuch a perſon is: It is ſad to loſe ſuch a faithful friend as <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and ſuch a loving and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When a perſon can ſay of a Miniſter, Had not the Lord ſent ſuch a one, I had (for ought I know) been damned, I had gone on in my ſinful curſed ways, and had everlaſtingly periſhed: But it pleaſed the Lord by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to open mine eyes, and to
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:41800:257"/> awaken my conſcience, to make me to ſee my ſins, and all my ſpiritual miſery, and to humble and break my heart, and to direct me in the way how my poor ſoul might be brought in to Chriſt: Yea, and did work ſo effectually, that at length I did by faith cloſe with Chriſt, and ſince that my ſoul hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with the joys and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Holy Ghoſt: And beſides all this, I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (at ſeveral times) ſpecial directions for my walking, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular helps againſt doubts, fears, and temptations, &amp;c. Truly the loſs of ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, of ſuch a Father will diſtreſs us, will melt us, will make our hearts to mourn and lament.</p>

                  <p>But the faithful and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Prophets (or Miniſters) of God, are a ſpecial means of Gods preſence with a people; which may thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. They are the ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments which God doth uſe to keep a people from ſin, and to bring them unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in caſe of ſinning: they warn and threaten them from the Lord, and teſtifie and cry aloud againſt their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and will not ſuffer them to go on in wickedneſs, but ſtrive with them, and exhort them daily, and preſs upon them all ſorts of Arguments (from Judgements and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) to ceaſe to do evil, and to learn to do well, to forſake their evil ways, and to turn to
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:41800:260"/> the Lord: this we finde in Scripture, and this we finde in experience, and therefore they are the moſt eminent means of ſafety unto a people.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, they are our ſins (and they only are) the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of all our miſeries; our ſinful evils bring upon us all our miſerable evils; thy ways and thy doings have procured theſe things unto thee; this is thy wickedneſs, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the fruit <note place="margin">Ier. 4. 18.</note> and effect thereof.</p>
                  <p>And if ſins be removed, then miſeries are removed, and all danger is over: God is again wel-pleaſed, and returns with loving kindneſs, and much proſperity unto a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as you may read in the times of the Judges, and of the Kings.</p>
                  <p>3. They are the choiſeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments

                  <p>And this is a peoples ſtrength and ſafety: Gods ways (and none but his) are ways of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; while a people walks in his ways, he will be their ſun and ſhield, their rock and ſtrength, their God, and their ſalvation.</p>

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:41800:261"/> ſuch among them) the faithful Prophets of God have been a means to convert wicked Governors, and to keep others of them right in the ways of God: you read of <hi>Jehoaſh, that he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, all his days wherein</hi> Jehoiada <hi>the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Kin. 12. 2.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>There are none who will deal with the Governors of a people ſo plainly, ſo conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, ſo ſeriouſly, ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the faithful Prophets of God: they will ſpeak to them when none elſe dare ſpeak to them; they will tell them of their ſins, as well as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors; they will make known unto them all the minde and will of God concerning them;
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:41800:261"/> they will put them upon the power &amp; practice of godlines, as wel as others, nay, more then others; they will ſtir up their hearts to be zealous for God, and his truth, and his ways, and not to ſuffer any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in the Land.</p>
                  <p>Now this comes to be of great ſtrength and ſafety to a people: as a peoples miſery lies very much in the iniquity of Rulers, ſo a peoples hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs lies much in the godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Rulers; if the Judgements of Rulers are right in the things of God, if their hearts do indeed love God, if they themſelves do make conſcience to walk in the ways of God, if they once come to be tender of the honour of God, and will own and encourage the power and
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:41800:262"/> practiſe of godlineſs: why, ſuch Rulers are a ſingular bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto a people, and they are a means of manifold bleſſings unto them: And therefore faithful and zealous Prophets are an eminent ſtrength and ſafety to a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who are ſpecial helps for all thoſe gracious qualities in ſuch as do govern a Nation.</p>
                  <p>5. I might add one thing more to demonſtrate the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that is this; faithful Prophets are much in prayer for a Civil State; and their prayers are very prevailing with God: Said <hi>Samuel, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                     <hi>and the heavens gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruits:</hi> his prayer was a means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Land: many more inſtances might be given, but I muſt haſten to the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all this unto our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Is the death and loſs of any <label type="milestone">

                  <p n="4">4. The great inconſideration of the death of ſo many choice Prophets &amp; Servants of God: To many perſons their life is a burden, and their death is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>

                  <p> When <hi>Mctellus</hi> heard of the death of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> he ran out into the publick <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or Market place, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>O Citizens, come ye forth,</hi>

                     <hi>and conſult what is to be done, for the walls of your City are fallen down:</hi> Surely there is matter of deep thoughts, and ſad af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in theſe ſolemn diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God of late. For an Husband man to pull out the weeds in the garden, this is nothing: but for him to pluck up the Flowers, and the choice Plants, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this: for him to take away the rotten Hedge, this is nothing, but to break down the wals about the Vineyard, there is ſomething in this. To take off a tile from the top of the houſe, it is nothing; O but to take away the Pillars, there is
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:41800:264"/> ſome great change now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. We read that when <hi>Noah</hi> (that Preacher of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs) was taken into the Ark, then the flood followed; ſeldom doth God gather his Prophets by cluſters (as it were) but there is ſome great evil neer unto a people: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs people (generally) are ſecure, and ſtupid, and fooliſh, though God ſmites them in one of the choiceſt bleſſings which he vouchſafes to the Sons of men.</p>
                  <p>They ſee loſs upon loſs, and death upon death; here a Miniſter dead, and there a Miniſter carried to his grave, and uſually this is all the fruits of it; Is ſuch a one dead? and I pray you how long was he ſick? and whereof did he die? and what hath he left his poor
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:41800:264"/> wife and children? It is great pitty, the man was an honeſt man, and preacht well; and here is all.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſuch careleſs, and cold, and dull perſons (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if any ſuch have had any reference unto faithful and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Miniſters) who can thus ſlightly paſs over the death of their Paſtors, I have four things to ſay.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a ſign that you never truly loved their perſons; no, no, for all your complements, and for all your pretences, yet you never truly loved them; of all affections, love is moſt apprehenſive and ſenſible. If it enjoys, there is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; If it loſeth, there is much ſorrow: love is very ſenſible of what it enjoyes, and of what it loſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="460" facs="tcp:41800:265"/> 2. It is a ſign that you never prized them in their Miniſtry; if you make no more of them being dead, certainly you made little of them being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: affections do moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and diſcover themſelves upon death: abſenſe, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and oppoſitions, and death, theſe are tryals and diſcoveries of true love, and therefore if you can ſo ſlightly bear the loſs of your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters, aſſuredly you never knew the worth and uſe of them as Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a ſign that you never received any Spiritual good by them at all, If you had done ſo, your hearts would have been knit unto them in life, and at leaſt have ſhed a tear for them in death.</p>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:41800:265"/>
                  <p> Their death would preſently call up all thoſe heavenly counſels, and all thoſe ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able directions, and all thoſe ſpiritual ſatisfactions, and all thoſe ſweet comforts of God, which you by them did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: At ſuch a time I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how he thus ſpake, and at ſuch a Sermon, and at ſuch a meeting, and in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and now I ſhall never ſee him more, nor confer with him more: the heart would melt to think of theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a ſign that God hath in Judgement taken away your faithful Miniſters from you, even for your want of love to the truth, and for your ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and neglecting the means of Grace, for which you muſt give a ſevere account unto God.</p>
                  <pb n="462" facs="tcp:41800:266"/>
                  <p> And let me tell you, that ſo many faithful Miniſters as you have heard, and ſo many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sermons as you have heard, (or ſhould have heard) the more heavy will the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be unto God, and the more dreadfull will Gods Judgements be upon you for your unthankfulneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs: I grant that the Prophets dye, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; that a peoples accounts for the pains and labours of thoſe Prophets never die, but do remain upon Record as a witneſs againſt you.</p>
                  <p>The next uſe ſhall be an <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Item unto all of us here this day, and more eſpecially to them who are particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in our great loſs; that they would in a ſingular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lay to heart this great
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:41800:266"/> breach which God hath made, and this great loſs which hath ſuddenly, and unexpectedly befallen us! Ah Sirs, Who that ſaw and heard that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Miniſter of Chriſt, the beginning of the laſt week, did think to hear of his death to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of the ſame week? who that heard him preaching of <hi>laying up treaſure in heaven,</hi> did imagine that ſuch a treaſure ſhould be taken away from earth, and himſelf (ſo ſuddenly) be laid up in heaven!</p>
                  <p>Alas! for me to ſpeak of this Prophet, and of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon loſs, of the many loſſes in this one loſs: truly, I am not fit, I am not able, becauſe I knew him much, and honored him much, and loved him much: only this I will ſay of
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:41800:267"/> him; That one ſo plain in heart, ſo deep in judgement, ſo painful in ſtudies, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and powerful, and exact in preaching, ſo laborious with, and uſeful to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, ſo able to convince the Gainſayer, ſo zealous in contending for the Truths of Chriſt, ſo fit for all Miniſterial Services (beſides his perſonal and domeſtical courſe of Godlineſs) of his time, I have not known the like.</p>
                  <p>Really, he was another <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah;</hi> let me a little compare them: How zealous was <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> againſt the falſe Prophets of <hi>Baal?</hi> How laborious was <hi>Elijah</hi> to bring back the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the true God, and to the true worſhip of God? How ſtout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute was <hi>Elijah</hi> in delivering
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:41800:267"/> the Meſſage of God, even to the face of King <hi>Ahab?</hi> How quick was he with <hi>Ahaziah</hi> for ſending meſſengers unto <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron?</hi> How fervent and potent in Prayer? How diligently laborious to his dying day? How ſudden was his remove and departure? All this Spirit, and much more then this of the Spirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> was found in him.</p>
                  <p>Now if you do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what eminent gifts and graces appeared in him, and how ſeriouſly, and humbly, and dexteriouſly theſe were laid out for the glory of Chriſt, and for the ſervice and benefit of the Church of Chriſt, we have cauſe in the loſs of ſuch a Prophet to cry out, <hi>My</hi>
                     <pb n="466" facs="tcp:41800:268"/> 
                     <hi>Father, my Father; The Charet of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Horſemen thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I will ſpeak no more of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> him, nor to you of him; his death I ſee hath made a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and deep impreſſion upon your hearts: All that remains to be ſpoken, ſhall be unto you his Hearers, and eſpecially unto you his late Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; there are four things which I would briefly offer unto you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Grieve in a Spiritual way, and upon Spiritual conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that God hath deprived you of ſuch a Spiritual Paſtor, and Helper, and Comforter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Remember and lay up thoſe ſoul-ſaving Truths, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you have ſo often heard from him, &amp; wiſely improve them, in all your occaſions: when
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:41800:268"/> 
                     <hi>Elijah</hi> was wrapt up to heaven, <hi>Eliſha</hi> took up the cloak which fell from him, and made uſe thereof: O take up all thoſe gracious inſtructions which fell from him in his life, and make uſe of them now after his death, keep them alive, and ſo you ſhal find him ſtil living.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hold faſt that form of wholſom words by him from Chriſt delivered unto you; and as you have received, ſo walk in them, let not your ſtedfaſtneſs dye, now he is dead.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Moſt humbly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſtrive with the Lord, by Faſting and Prayer, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is his will to take away <hi>Elijah</hi> from you, that he would be pleaſed in his love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to give unto you an <hi>Eliſha</hi> in his room.</p>
